Thu, Aug 14 2008 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r6055
  * Added E1 CAS support. Uses new firmware.
  * New firmware also solve DTMF problems with some phones (double digits).
  * Bugfix in caller_id_style parameter to xpd_fxo. Now caller_id_style=2
    actually works (always pass PCM).
  * Warn about DAHDI ioctls sent to us by mistake (helps catching problems
    during migration).
  * Parse per-channel alarms the perl modules. Use this
    to add an Zaptel::Chans->alarm() method. Update lszaptel
    accordingly.
  * Better parsing of signalling information in Zaptel::Chans
  * Documentation updates in Zaptel::Span
  * Fix some rare cases of false Yellow alarms in PRI.
  * Updates to PCI IDs in Zaptel::Hardware::PCI
  * Bugfix in blinking leds (rare, was detected with specific compiler 
    versions).
  * Safer test in Kbuild for BRI compilation.
  * Bugfix in DTMF (was leaking from one channel to the next one).
  * Fix a rare problem in ONHOOK detection.
  * Fix a build problem with Centos-5.2 (backporting bool).
  * Debugging improvement: the pcmtx_chan parameter now refers
    to zaptel channel numbers.

Tue, 13 May 2008 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r5744
  * New firmware protocol version: 30
  * New numbers for the device types: (e.g. in card_init* scripts)
    - FXS: 1 (was: 3)
    - FXO: 2 (was: 4)
    - BRI: 3 (was: 6 for TE, 7 for NT)
    - PRI: 4 (was: 9)
  * Init scripts of FXS and FXO modules are now written in Perl as well
    (be sure to have File::Basename, e.g: perl-modules in Debian).
  * calibrate_slics merged into init_card_1_30 .
  * Each of the init_card_* scripts now runs no more than once per card even
    if this card represents several XPD's (e.g: quad PRI, BRI). This means
    maximum of 4 script runs per Astribank.
  * Zaptel registration now briefly flash all LED's (not just the green ones as
    before).
  * Module parameter print_dbg was renamed to debug for consistency with
    the rest of zaptel.
  * init_fxo_modes removed: content moved into init_card_2_30, verified
    at build time.
  * FXO: removed polling for power-denial. New firmware notifies us.
  * Code tested with sparse. Most warnings were fixed.
  * Set ZT_SIG_DACS for the bchans in the PRI and BRI modules to not get
    ignored by ztscan.
  * fpga_load: Handle null config_desc we get from some crazy USB controllers.
  * genzaptelconf: Fix reporting of empty slots in list mode.
  * xpp_blink can now blink the led of a single analog port.
  * "slics" has been renamed "chipregs".
  * Fixed a small typo in fpga_load(8).
  * Fixed bashism in xpp_fxloader.

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r5566
  * Build:
    - Zaptel >= 1.4.9 is migrating to storing kernel stuff in zaptel/kernel/*
    -  We conditionally use old/new directory scheme:
       In xpp/Kbuild and xpp/utils/Makefile use ZAP_KERNEL variable, so it's
       not confused with ZAPTEL_DIR (which appears in zaptel/Makefile as well).
    - Fix compile warnings on 64 bit systems.
    - Compile fixes for kernel-2.6.24
  * UDEV:
    - /etc/udev/rules.d/xpp.rules now uses XPP_INIT_DIR to find astribank_hook.
    - astribank_hook: Modify to do nothing. Add some documentation.
  * Autoconfiguration -- zapconf:
    - Don't fail zapconf et.al. if no config file was found.
    - Skip the 'IRQ Missing:' line in /proc/zaptel/nnn for wcte1xp(?).
    - Add some newer Digium cards to our hardware inventory.
    - Partially handle cases where the /proc/zaptel strings does not contain
      info about E1/T1/J1 or NT/TE.
  * Better SYNC:
    - Finer tuning of PLL (New firmware).
    - Change calculation algorithm of sync offset. It now copes better
      with the variance in USB frame reception timing.
    - Statistics:
      . The view of results was moved from /proc/xpp/XBUS-*/summary to
        a new /sys/bus/astribanks/devices/xbus-*/timing and enhanced.
      . A new xpp_timing script shows all astribanks.
      . A new write only /sys/bus/astribanks/devices/xbus-*/cls is
        used to clear statistics. Eventually, clearing of XBUS related
        statistics should be done here. One that was migrated is the
        clearing of 'PCM [TR]X:' numbers currently appearing in
        /proc/xpp/XBUS-*/summary (they should be moved too later).
    - Shorten the strings representation sync_mode ("SYNC_MODE_AB" -> "AB")
      adapted their use in printk and /proc so the text is clear.
    - Added a command line parameter xpp.disable_pll_sync to stop all
      adjustments command to AB (calculations still continue as usual).
  * PRI:
    - 4 port support
    - set clocking master span via ztcfg, like other zaptel devices.
  * FXO:
    - Fix false hangups in some countries (voltage fluctuations).
    - Some countries send caller-id before first ring.
      Added code to handle caller-id PCM pass through according to
      a new command line parameter (xpd_fxo.caller_id_style).
    - No longer sends an event on zt_open. See #12160 .
  * FXS: Re-enable dtmf_detection.
  * Misc:
    - Adapt to zaptel-1.4.8 and above ztscan: added fields returend by
      new ZT_SPANSTAT_V2 ioctl()
    - Document sysfs and waitfor_xpds.
    - Miscelaneous optimizations and bugfixes.
    - Remove deprecated pcm_tasklet parameter. The rx_tasklet parameter has
      replaced it a long time ago.
    - Add RX_CMD counter to /proc/xpp/XBUS-*/summary
    - Unclutter some of the usb disconnect messages.
    - xpp_usb: minor preformance improvements in receive.
      Expose the number of pending receive URB's in /proc/xpp/XBUS-*/xpp_usb
Thu Jan 10 2008 Oron Peled <oron.peled@xorcom.com> - xpp.r5254
  * Improved polarity reversal hangups in FXO (r5194).
    Fixed false detection of polarity reversals.
  * Optimize xframe allocation, by not zeroing the whole
    memory (in get_xframe()).
  * Fixed erronous error message that appeared sometimes
    from fpga_load during USB renumeration.
  * Zaptel::Chans now provides battery() reporting for some FXO
    channels (Astribank FXO and wcfxo).

Tue Dec 25 2007 Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com> - xpp.r5179
  * xpd_pri: Basically ready.
  * PCM synchronization changes:
    - Each Astribank unit ticks independently. Each with its own PLL.
    - HOST synchronization is gone. Loading of xpp will no longer cause
      useless 250 ticks per second if you have no Astribank.
    - Synchronization from the zaptel sync master requires setting
      ZAPTEL as sync source (xpp_sync ZAPTEL).
  * rx_tasklet is now a parameter of the module xpp, rather than of xpp_usb.
  * New FPGA firmware: 5128 (1151) / 5122 (1141, 1131):
    - Fixes synchronization issues.
    - PRI module: E1/T1 should now work.
  * perl module and utilities:
    - Modules no longer magically scan system on initialization.
    - Scanning is by calling explicit methods.
    - "Serial" has been renamed "Label". It is basically unique, but 
      should be modifieble.
    - Some basic documentation of zaptel perl modules.
  * Default sort order of zt_registration is back to SORT_CONNCTOR.
  * zt_registration proc file now shows the number of span registered to 
    if registered. Try: grep . /proc/xpp/XBUS-*/XPD-*/zt_registration
  * genzaptelconf: Allow using a custom command instead of
    /etc/init.d/asterisk to start/stop asterisk.
  * Fixed the typo "Slagish".

Wed Nov 14 2007 Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com> - xpp.r5010
  * Fix a deadlock spotted on some SMP installations.
  * increase FXS ring detect debounce interval.

  * zaptel-perl: further fixes to handling of empty slots.

Wed Oct  3 2007 Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com> - xpp.r4900
  * Zaptel/Hardware perl modules: 
    - Use sysfs directly. Don't rely on lspci/lsusb.
    - Each device has a description and driver name.
    - Zaptel::Hardware::drivers() to show the list of required drivers
      for this system (see zaptel_drivers).
    - zaptel_hardware shows a description and a (suggested?) driver.
  * zt_registration sorts by Serial first and only then by connector.
  * USB_FW.hex replaces all the USB_11x0.hex .
    - Separate USB interface for the management processor.
    - Hence fpga_load can now work even with drivers loaded.
  * Fix firmware upgrading.
  * Fix manual firmware loading while auto-loading.
  * Fix opermode parameter for FXO initialization (broken in r4648).

Wed Oct  3 2007 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r4786
  * New firmware protocol version: 2.9 .
  * fpga_load: initial clean-ups before interface split.
  * genzaptelconf: Don't leave an empty directory behind (4784)
  * Increase xpp poll_timeout to 1000ms - useful for CentOS 4 (r4781).
  * Fix initialization anoyance: if AB don't answer to polls, don't
    waitfor_xpds, and show no waiting XPDs (r4725).
  * Disable dtmf_detection by default once again (r4712).
  * Don't check twice for asterisk to stop. The second test was done 
    while Asterisk was still stopping (r4708).
  * Support building the kernel with M= instead of with SUBDIRS= , as
    used in some newer build systems (r4677).

Tue Sep 11 2007 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r4648
  * New firmware protocol version: 2.8 .
  * Cleanup INFO() messages during module loading.

  * USB: Receive queue with TASKLETS [r4600].  Controlled by rx_tasklet
    parameter to xpp_usb module (can be changed in runtime).
  * The pcm_tasklet parameter in xpp module is deprecated:
    - Does not actually do anything.
    - If set during module loading, shows an ERR() message.
    - Also appears in /proc/xpp/sync

  * FXS: Hardware DTMF detection by default, can be disabled
    by setting dtmf_detection=0 parameter to xpd_fxs.
    PCM is muted when DTMF key is pressed.

  * zapconf:
    - Can now generate users.conf compatible with asterisk-gui.
    - Optional command-line arguments denoting which files to generate.
      Possible values are 'zaptel', 'zapata' and 'users'.
    - Defaults to creating zaptel and zapata.

  * Update to zaptel-1.4.5.1, zaptel-1.2.20.1
  * Fix building on kernel 2.6.23rc1, from Axel Thimm.
  * New firmware to fix FXS leds irregularities.
  * Less noise at build time - don't echo version, test compile ony once.
  * zapconf can generate users.conf snippets.

Thu Aug 16 2007 Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com> - xpp.r4515
  * Don't use Astribanks connected to USB1 interfaces
    Unless the user set the option usb1=1 for xpp_usb (r4504).
  * README.Astribank can now be generated from the makefile (r4503).
  * Demote the messages about PCM in non-PCM from notice to debug (r4501).
  * Fix sample BRI zapata.conf: NT instead of TE (r4498).
  * Disable FXS hardware DTMF detection by default (r4492).
  * Extra Zaptel PCI IDs (from Philipp Kempgen) (r4466).

Thu Aug  2 2007 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r4464
  * Jump to zaptel-1.2.19 and zaptel-1.4.4 (with/without bristuff)
  * BRI improvement: an 'nt_keepalive' parameter to xpd_bri forces
    a BRI_NT to retry a connection indefinitely (this is our default).
    When false it revert to the behaviour in changeset:4415 ("Bezeq like")
  * Improvement in DBG macros. The print_dbg parameter is now set of
    flags to debug. They are defined in zap_debug.h
  * PRI configuration improvements (r4462):
    - Hardcoded default (in init_card_9_26) is TE.
    - The variable XPP_PRI_SETUP (in /etc/default/zaptel) may config
      all PRI ports or some of them as we wish. Full docs are in
      the utils/example_default_zaptel.
  * PRI D-channel indication: Similar to BRI (r4464).

Thu Jul 30 2007 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r4415
  * Show Astribank 6+2 as 6/2 channels and not 8/8 channels.
    - Added as a "subtype" to the device type (r4391).
  * Fixed a panic in BRI span shutdown method (r4393).
  * Changes to debug macros.
  * Add proper sysfs support (r4406)
    - A bus on whuch all of the Astribanks reside.
    - Replaces useless sysfs code that existed in the module.
    - Currently used to set the sync source automatically at device
      adition / removal.
  * BRI: We do need the T1 timer in NT. If it gets into G2 state (rr4407).

Thu Jul 12 2007 Oron Peled <oron@actcom.co.il> - xpp.r4372

  * Tested with zaptel-1.2.17.1
  * Add D-Channel TX, RX and BAD frames count in /proc/xpp/XBUS-*/XPD-*/bri_info
  * Adjust output of xpp_sync script. Pad for 8 port BRI.
  * Added a debugging module parport_debug (not compiled by default).
  * Added an optional patch to zaptel:
      - compiles only if ZAPTEL_SYNC_TICK is defined
      - Allow interested driver to register for "sync" notification.
      - Does not affect drivers that do not use this feature.
  * Added external synchronization feature:
      - Only if ZAPTEL_SYNC_TICK feature is compiled in
      - Than XPP may be synchronized by another card (e.g: an Astribank
        with FXS can be synchronized by a Digium PRI card).
      - May be enabled/disabled in runtime via the 'sync_tick_active' module
        parameter to the xpp.ko module.
  * Fixed a potential bug in D-Channel hexdump printing.
  * New visual indications in BRI leds:
      - Constant ON RED/GREEN: Shows the port type -- NT/TE.
      - Very fast "double blink": Layer1 work, no D-Channel yet. 
      - Steady blinking (1/2 sec): D-Channel trafic detected. 
  * xpp_fxloader moved to /usr/share/zaptel .
