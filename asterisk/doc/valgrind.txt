If you're having certain types of crashes, such as those associated with
memory corruption, a bug marshal may ask you to run Asterisk under valgrind.
You should follow these steps, to give the bug marshal the maximum amount
of information about the crash.

1.  Run 'make menuselect' and in the Compiler Options, enable MALLOC_DEBUG
	and DONT_OPTIMIZE.  A bug marshal may also ask you to enable additional
	compiler flags, such as DEBUG_THREADS, depending upon the nature of the
	issue.

2.  Rebuild and install Asterisk.

3.  Run Asterisk as follows:
	valgrind --suppressions=/usr/src/asterisk/contrib/valgrind.supp --log-fd=9 asterisk -vvvvcg 9>valgrind.txt
	
	Where /usr/src/asterisk/ is location of asterisk source code.

4.  Reproduce the issue.  Following the manifestation of the issue (or when
	the process crashes), upload the valgrind.txt to the issue tracker.

Please note that even if valgrind prevents Asterisk from crashing, the
information logged may STILL be of use to developers, so please upload the
resulting log file whether Asterisk crashes or not.
