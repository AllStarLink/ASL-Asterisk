Asterisk Main Configuration File
-----------------------------------------------------
Below is a sample of the main Asterisk configuration file,
asterisk.conf. Note that this file is _not_ provided in
sample form, because the Makefile creates it when needed
and does not touch it when it already exists.

---------------

[directories]
; Make sure these directories have the right permissions if not
; running Asterisk as root 

; Where the configuration files (except for this one) are located
astetcdir => /etc/asterisk

; Where the Asterisk loadable modules are located
astmoddir => /usr/lib/asterisk/modules

; Where additional 'library' elements (scripts, etc.) are located
astvarlibdir => /var/lib/asterisk

; Where AGI scripts/programs are located
astagidir => /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin

; Where spool directories are located
; Voicemail, monitor, dictation and other apps will create files here
; and outgoing call files (used with pbx_spool) must be placed here
astspooldir => /var/spool/asterisk

; Where the Asterisk process ID (pid) file should be created
astrundir => /var/run/asterisk

; Where the Asterisk log files should be created
astlogdir => /var/log/asterisk

;Under "options" you can enter configuration options
;that you also can set with command line options

;These options have no command line equivalent
cache_record_files = yes | no			; Cache record() files in another directory until completion
record_cache_dir = <dir>
transcode_via_sln = yes | no 			; Build transcode paths via SLINEAR
transmit_silence_during_record = yes | no	; send SLINEAR silence while channel is being recorded

						; when on, sound files are search as <lang>/<path>/<file>
						; (only affects relative paths for sound files)
dahdichanname = yes | no			; Should channels created by chan_dahdi be called 'DAHDI' or 'Zap';
						; defaults to 'DAHDI' if built against DAHDI, and 'Zap' if built
						; against Zaptel; also used by other applications so that they will
						; know what channel name to expect

[files]
; Changing the following lines may compromise your security
; Asterisk.ctl is the pipe that is used to connect the remote CLI
; (asterisk -r) to Asterisk. Changing these settings change the
; permissions and ownership of this file. 
; The file is created when Asterisk starts, in the "astrundir" above.

;astctlpermissions = 0660
;astctlowner = root
;astctlgroup = asterisk
;astctl = asterisk.ctl
