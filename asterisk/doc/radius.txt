Call Detail Recording to RADIUS Server
======================================


Configuration of Asterisk to send CDRs to (Free)RADIUS servers.


A. What is needed :
	* FreeRADIUS server
	* Radiusclient-ng library
	* Asterisk PBX


	+--------------------+
        |    Asterisk PBX    |
        |                    |
        |********************|
	|                    |        +---------------+
        |    RADIUS client   |------->| RADIUS server |
	|                    |<-------| (FreeRADIUS)  |
	+--------------------+        +---------------+




B. Steps to follow in order to have RADIUS support:

 1.Radiusclient library  
	1.a Installation
		
		Download the sources from:
		
		http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/
		
		Untar the source tarball.
			root@localhost:/usr/local/src# tar xvfz radiusclient-ng-0.5.2.tar.gz

		Compile and install the library.
			root@localhost:/usr/local/src# cd radiusclient-ng-0.5.2
			root@localhost:/usr/local/src/radiusclient-ng-0.5.2# ./configure
			root@localhost:/usr/local/src/radiusclient-ng-0.5.2# make
			root@localhost:/usr/local/src/radiusclient-ng-0.5.2# make install

 	1.b	Configuration
	
		By default all the configuration files of the radiusclient library will
		be in /usr/local/etc/radiusclient-ng directory.
		
		File "radiusclient.conf"
			Open the file and find lines containing the following:

				authserver      localhost
	
		This is the hostname or IP address of the RADIUS server used for 
		authentication. You will have to change this unless the server is 
		running on the same host as your Asterisk PBX.

				acctserver      localhost

		This is the hostname or IP address of the RADIUS server used for 
		accounting. You will have to change this unless the server is running
		on the same host as your Asterisk PBX.

		File "servers" 
		
		RADIUS protocol uses simple access control mechanism based on shared
		secrets that allows RADIUS servers to limit access from RADIUS clients.
		
		A RADIUS server is configured with a secret string and only RADIUS 
		clients that have the same secret will be accepted.

		You need to configure a shared secret for each server you have 
		configured in radiusclient.conf file in the previous step. The shared 
		secrets are stored in /usr/local/etc/radiusclient-ng/servers file.

		Each line contains hostname of a RADIUS server and shared secret 
		used in communication with that server. The two values are separated 
		by white spaces. Configure shared secrets for every RADIUS server you 
		are going to use.

		File "dictionary"
			
		Asterisk uses some attributes that are not included in the 
		dictionary of radiusclient library, therefore it is necessary to add 
		them. A file called dictionary.digium (kept in the contrib dir)
 		was created to list all new attributes used by Asterisk. 
		Add to the end of the main dictionary file
		/usr/local/etc/radiusclient-ng/dictionary
		the line:

			$INCLUDE /path/to/dictionary.digium

 2.FreeRADIUS Server (Version 1.1.1)
 	2.a Installation
			
		Download sources tarball from:

			http://freeradius.org/
			
 		Untar, configure, build, and install the server:

				root@localhost:/usr/local/src# tar xvfz freeradius-1.1.1.tar.gz
				root@localhost:/usr/local/src# cd freeradius-1.1.1
				root@localhost"/usr/local/src/freeradius-1.1.1# ./configure
				root@localhost"/usr/local/src/freeradius-1.1.1# make
				root@localhost"/usr/local/src/freeradius-1.1.1# make install

		All the configuration files of FreeRADIUS server will be in 
		/usr/local/etc/raddb directory. 
		

 	2.b Configuration
			
		There are several file that have to be modified to configure the
		RADIUS server. These are presented next.

		File "clients.conf"
			
		File /usr/local/etc/raddb/clients.conf contains description of 
		RADIUS clients that are allowed to use the server. For each of the 
		clients you need to specify its hostname or IP address and also a 
		shared secret. The shared secret must be the same string you configured
		in radiusclient library.

		Example:
			client myhost {
			    secret = mysecret
			    shortname = foo
			}
		
		This fragment allows access from RADIUS clients on "myhost" if they use 
		"mysecret" as the shared secret.	 
		The file already contains an entry for localhost (127.0.0.1), so if you
		are running the RADIUS server on the same host as your Asterisk server,
		then modify the existing entry instead, replacing the default password.

		File "dictionary"
			
		Note : as of version 1.1.2, the dictionary.digium file ships with FreeRADIUS. 
		The following procedure brings the dictionary.digium file to previous versions 
		of FreeRADIUS.
		
		File /usr/local/etc/raddb/dictionary contains the dictionary of 
		FreeRADIUS server. You have to add the same dictionary file 
		(dictionary.digium), which you added to the dictionary of radiusclient-ng
		library. You can include it into the main file, adding the following line at the
		end of file '/usr/local/etc/raddb/dictionary':
			
			$INCLUDE /path/to/dictionary.digium

		That will include the same new attribute definitions that are used 
		in radiusclient-ng library so the client and server will understand each 
		other. 


 3. Asterisk Accounting Configuration

	Compilation and installation:
        The module will be compiled as long as the radiusclient-ng
        library has been detected on your system.
	
	By default FreeRADIUS server will log all accounting requests into 
	/usr/local/var/log/radius/radacct directory in form of plain text files. 
	The server will create one file for each hostname in the directory. The 
	following example shows how the log files look like. 

	Asterisk now generates Call Detail Records. See /include/asterisk/cdr.h
	for all the fields which are recorded. By default, records in comma 
	separated values will be created in /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv. 

	The configuration file for cdr_radius.so module is :

        /etc/asterisk/cdr.conf 
	This is where you can set CDR related parameters as well as the path to
	the radiusclient-ng library configuration file.
