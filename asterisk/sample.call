#
# This is a sample file that can be dumped in /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing
# to generate a call.  For Asterisk to read call files, you must have the
# pbx_spool.so module loaded.
#
# Comments are indicated by a '#' character that begins a line, or follows
# a space or tab character.  To be consistent with the configuration files
# in Asterisk, comments can also be indicated by a semicolon.  However, the
# multiline comments (;-- --;) used in Asterisk configuration files are not 
# supported.  Semicolons can be escaped by a backslash.
#

# Obviously, you MUST specify at least a channel in the same format as you
# would for the "Dial" application.  Only one channel name is permitted.
#
Channel: Zap/1
#
# You can specify codecs for the call
Codecs: alaw, speex, h264
#
# You may also specify a wait time (default is 45 seconds) for how long to
# wait for the channel to be answered, a retry time (default is 5 mins)
# for how soon to retry this call, and a maximum number of retries (default
# is 0) for how many times to retry this call.
#
MaxRetries: 2
RetryTime: 60
WaitTime: 30

#
# Once the call is answered, you must provide either an application/data
# combination, or a context/extension/priority in which to start the PBX.
#
Context: default
Extension: s
Priority: 1

#
# Alternatively you can specify just an application
# and its arguments to be run, instead of a context
# extension and priority
#
#Application: VoicemailMain
#Data: 1234

#
# You can set the callerid that will be used for the outgoing call
#
#Callerid: Wakeup Call Service <(555) 555-5555>

#
# An account code can be specified the following way:
#
#Account: mysuperfunaccountcode

#
# Normally, a call file is always deleted after the call is successful
# or the maximum number of tries is reached even if the modification
# time of the call file was changed during the call to be in the
# future.  By Setting AlwaysDelete to No the modification time of the
# call file will be checked after the call is completed or the maximum
# number of retries is reached.  If the modification time is in the
# future, the call file will not be deleted.
#
#AlwaysDelete: Yes

#
# You can set channel variables that will be passed to the channel.
# This includes writable dialplan functions. To set a writable dialplan
# function, the module containing this function *must* be loaded.
#
#Set: file1=/tmp/to
#Set: file2=/tmp/msg
#Set: timestamp=20021023104500
#Set: CDR(userfield|r)=42

#
# Setting Archive to yes the call file is never deleted, but is moved
# in the subdir "outgoing_done" of the spool directory. In this case 
# will be appended a line with "Status: value", where value can be 
# Completed, Expired or Failed.
#
#Archive: yes
