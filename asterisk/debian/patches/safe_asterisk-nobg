Add an option to safe_asterisk so that it won't background.

This is intended to work with start-stop-daemon's --background option which
results in a correct pidfile since the process doesn't fork.

#376514, #362281

Needs more work from me to not change behavior for users but only for the
init script. After that, it can safely go upstream.
