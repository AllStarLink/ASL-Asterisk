    - Dropped patches samples, vpb-driver-4.2.18, vpb_no_cards, incorporated
      by upstream.

    - Revert API changes to ast_sendtext() (ast-send-message).
    - Merge several chan_zap changes (zapata-bri+euroisdn, zapata-gsm).
    - Remove unused zapata-device-state, feature-parking_con, find-feature,
      chan-capi, ast_channel_masquerade_locked, find-feature patches,
      obsoleted by upstream.
    - Remove uniqueid-01-use-pid-on-uniqueid-generation patch, dropped by
      upstream.
    - Rename app-zapras-fix-audiomode to isdn-fixes and include another fix
      that we dropped earlier by mistake (r5162).
    - Merge ast-send-message with ast-send-message-users, following upstream
      split.
    - Other minor and cosmetic fixes.
    - Comment-out the only use of ast-send-message (in GSM) to avoid an ABI
      change. We are not shipping GSM, hence this is not a feature regression.
  * Conflict with asterisk-chan-capi << 1.1.1-1 which we broke with an ABI
    change :( (Closes: #472379).
  * Drop doc-base entries for sip.conf and zapata.conf, there was no point in

  * Override some lintian warnings for asterisk (empty IAX firmware and
    static-http directories) and asterisk-sounds-main (empty MOH and es/fr

    that use 1.4's ABI can depend on that.
  * Switch asterisk-h323 to the new asterisk-1.4 dependency.
