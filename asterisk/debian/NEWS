asterisk (1:1.4.13~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since this version, ODBC and IMAP storage for Voicemail are provided.
  As this could not be done as a runtime option, app_voicemail_odbc.so and
  app_voicemail_imap.so are provided. However, these conflict app_voicemail.so
  and each other.
  If you use a modified modules.conf and you have autoload enabled, you *must*
  add explicit noload entries for two of the three voicemail modules.

asterisk (1:1.0.7.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The Debian version of the upstream asterisk source has had the fpm Music on Hold
  removed as this music has only been licenced for use within asterisk which is
  incompatible with the Debian Free Software Guildlines 
  <http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines>. Please drop your alternative
  Music on Hold into the directory /usr/share/asterisk/mohmp3/
