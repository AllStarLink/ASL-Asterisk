	* main/loader.c: Fix breakage of the "module load <module>" CLI
	  command.

	  formats/format_g729.c, formats/format_sln.c,
	  formats/format_wav.c, formats/format_ogg_vorbis.c,
	  formats/format_wav_gsm.c: Set a module load priority for format
	  modules. A recent change to app_voicemail made it such that the
	  module now assumes that all format modules are available while
	  processing voicemail configuration. However, when autoloading
	  modules, it was possible that app_voicemail was loaded before the
	  format modules. Since format modules don't depend on anything,
	  set a module load priority on them to ensure that they get loaded
	  first when autoloading. This version of the patch is specific to
	  Asterisk 1.4 and 1.6.0. These versions did not already support
	  module load priority in the module API. This adds a trivial
	  version of this which is just a module flag to include it in a
	  pass before loading "everything". Thanks to mmichelson for the
	  review! (closes issue #16412) Reported by: jiddings Tested by:

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: IAX2: VNAK loop caused by signaling frames
	  with no destination call number It is possible for the PBX thread
	  to queue up signaling frames before a destination call number is

	  no destination call number. Since recent versions of Asterisk
	  require accurate destination callnumbers for all Full Frames,
	  this can cause a VNAK loop to occur. To resolve this no signaling
	  frames are sent until a destination callnumber is received, and
	  destination call numbers are now only required for iax_pvt

	  chan_dahdi is designed in such a way to set certain values in the
	  dahdi_pvt only once. One of those such values is the configured
	  caller id data in chan_dahdi.conf. For PRI, the configured caller
	  id data could be overwritten during a call. Instead of saving the
	  data and restoring, it was decided that for all non-analog
	  channels it was simply best to not set the configured caller id

	* include/asterisk/file.h, main/frame.c, main/file.c,
	  include/asterisk/frame.h: Make filestream frame handling safer by
	  isolating frames before returning them. This patch is related to
	  a number of issues on the bug tracker that show crashes related
	  to freeing frames that came from a filestream. A number of fixes
	  have been made over time while trying to figure out these
	  problems, but there re still people seeing the crash. (Note that
	  some of these bug reports include information about other
	  problems. I am specifically addressing the filestream frame crash
	  here.) I'm still not clear on what the exact problem is. However,
	  what is _very_ clear is that we have seen quite a few problems
	  over time related to unexpected behavior when we try to use
	  embedded frames as an optimization. In some cases, this
	  optimization doesn't really provide much due to improvements made
	  in other areas. In this case, the patch modifies filestream
	  handling such that the embedded frame will not be returned.
	  ast_frisolate() is used to ensure that we end up with a
	  completely mallocd frame. In reality, though, we will not
	  actually have to malloc every time. For filestreams, the frame
	  will almost always be allocated and freed in the same thread.
	  That means that the thread local frame cache will be used. So,
	  going this route doesn't hurt. With this patch in place, some
	  people have reported success in not seeing the crash anymore.

	  there is a reinvite, unless the 'constantssrc' is set to true in
	  sip.conf. The original issue reported to Digium support detailed
	  the following situation: ITSP <-> Asterisk 1.4.26.2 <-> SIP-based
	  Application Server Call comes in fromITSP, Asterisk dials the app
	  server which sends a re-invite back toAsterisk--not to negotiate
	  to send media directly to the ITSP, but to indicatethat it's
	  changing the stream it's sending to Asterisk. The app
	  servergenerates a new SSRC, sequence numbers, timestamps, and
	  sets the marker bit on the new stream. Asterisk passes through
	  the teimstamp of the new stream, butdoes not reset the SSRC,
	  sequence numbers, or set the marker bit. When the timestamp on
	  the new stream is older than the timestamp on the originalstream,
	  the ITSP (which doesn't know there has been any change) discards
	  the newframes because it thinks they are too old. This patch
	  addresses this by changing the SSRC on a stream update unless
	  constantssrc=true is set in sip.conf. Review:

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: IAX2 encryption regression The IAX2 Call
	  Token security patch inadvertently broke the use of encryption
	  due to the reorganization of code in the socket_process()

	  first be decrypted before the information elements can be parsed.
	  The security release mistakenly moved IE parsing before
	  decryption in order to process the new Call Token IE. To resolve
	  this, decryption of full frames is once again done before looking
	  into the frame. This involves searching for an existing callno,
	  checking the pvt to see if encryption is turned on, and
	  decrypting the packet before the internal fields of the full
	  frame are accessed. associated with AST-2009-006 (closes issue

	* apps/app_playback.c, main/pbx.c, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  apps/app_disa.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Make apps send PROGRESS
	  control frame for early media and fix too early media issue in
	  SIP The issue at hand is that some legacy (dying) PBX systems
	  send empty media frames on PRI links *before* any call progress.
	  The SIP channel receives these frames and by default signals 183
	  Session progress and starts sending media. This will cause phones
	  to play silence and ignore the later 180 ringing message. A bad
	  user experience. The fix is twofold: - We discovered that
	  asterisk apps that support early media ("noanswer") did not send
	  any PROGRESS frame to indicate early media. Fixed. - We introduce
	  a setting in chan_sip so that users can disable any relay of
	  media frames before the outbound channel actually indicates any
	  sort of call progress. In 1.4, 1.6.0 and 1.6.1, this will be
	  disabled for backward compatibility. In later versions of
	  Asterisk, this will be enabled. We don't assume that it will
	  change your Asterisk phone experience - only for the better. We
	  encourage third-party application developers to make sure that if
	  they have applications that wants to send early media, add a
	  PROGRESS control frame transmission to make sure that all channel
	  drivers actually will start sending early media. This has not
	  been the default in Asterisk previous to this patch, so if you
	  got inspiration from our code, you need to update accordingly.
	  Sorry for the trouble and thanks for your support. This code has
	  been running for a few months in a large scale installation (over
	  250 servers with PRI and/or BRI links to old PBX systems). That's
	  no proof that this is an excellent patch, but, well, it's tested
	  :-)

	* main/channel.c: Modify comment to be a bit more accurate. We have
	  kept this comment around long enough, that it's pretty clear that

	* main/channel.c: ast_write() ignores ast_audiohook_write() results
	  In ast_write(), if a channel has a list of audiohooks, those
	  lists are written to and the resulting frame is what ast_write()
	  should continue with. The problem was the returned audiohook
	  frame was not being handled at all, and the original frame passed
	  into it did not contain the mixed audio, so essentially audio was
	  being lost. One result of this was chan_spy's whisper mode no
	  longer worked. To complicate the issue, frames passed into
	  ast_write may either be a single frame, or a list of frames. So,
	  as the list of frames is processed in the audiohook_write, the
	  returned frames had to be added to a new list. (closes issue

	  the build system so that user-provided flags (in ASTCFLAGS and
	  ASTLDFLAGS) are supplied to the compiler/linker *after* all flags
	  provided by the build system itself, so that the user can
	  effectively override the build system's flags if desired. In
	  addition, ASTCFLAGS and ASTLDFLAGS can now be provided *either*
	  in the environment before running 'make', or as variable
	  assignments on the 'make' command line. As a result, the use of
	  COPTS and LDOPTS is no longer necessary, so they are no longer
	  documented, but are still supported so as not to break existing
	  build systems that supply them when building Asterisk.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Answer video SDP offers properly when
	  videosupport is not enabled. Copied from Review board: In issue
	  12434, the reporter describes a situation in which audio and
	  video is offered on the call, but because videosupport is
	  disabled in sip.conf, Asterisk gives no response at all to the
	  video offer. According to RFC 3264, all media offers should have
	  a corresponding answer. For offers we do not intend to actually
	  reply to with meaningful values, we should still reply with the
	  port for the media stream set to 0. In this patch, we take note
	  of what types of media have been offered and save the information
	  on the sip_pvt. The SDP in the response will take into account
	  whether media was offered. If we are not otherwise going to
	  answer a media offer, we will insert an appropriate m= line with
	  the port set to 0. It is important to note that this patch is
	  pretty much a bandage being applied to a broken bone. The patch
	  *only* helps for situations where video is offered but
	  videosupport is disabled and when udptl_pt is disabled but T.38
	  is offered. Asterisk is not guaranteed to respond to every media
	  offer. Notable cases are when multiple streams of the same type
	  are offered. The 2 media stream limit is still present with this
	  patch, too. In trunk and the 1.6.X branches, things will be a bit
	  different since Asterisk also supports text in SDPs as well.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Properly ACK 487 responses to canceled
	  INVITEs. From the review board request: The fix from review 298
	  has exposed a new bug in chan_sip. When we hang up an outgoing
	  call, we first will dump all the outstanding packets on the
	  sip_pvt using __sip_pretend_ack. Then, if we can, we send a
	  CANCEL. The problem with this is that since destroyed all the
	  outstanding packets on the dialog, we cannot match the incoming
	  487 response to our INVITE. Because we cannot match the response,
	  we do not send an ACK. To correct this, instead of using
	  __sip_pretend_ack, I have changed the code to loop through the
	  list of packets and call __sip_semi_ack on each one instead. This
	  causes us to stop retransmitting the requests, but we still have
	  them around in case we get responses for them. When discussing
	  this earlier today with Josh Colp, we both agreed that in the
	  majority of cases, this would be enough of a fix. However, we
	  also agreed that we should have a safety net in place in case we
	  never receive a response to our initial INVITE. To handle this, I
	  have modified __sip_autodestruct to behave similar to the way it
	  does in Asterisk 1.4. If there are outstanding packets on the
	  sip_pvt, the needdestroy flag is not set, and the last request on
	  the dialog was either a CANCEL or BYE, then we set the
	  needdestroy flag and reschedule destruction for 10 seconds in the
	  future. If, though, the needdestroy flag is set, then we use
	  __sip_pretend_ack to kill the remaining outstanding packets so
	  that the monitor thread can destroy the sip_pvt. I ran two
	  separate tests. First, I placed a call from my Aastra phone to my
	  Polycom phone. I hung up the Aastra before the Polycom answered.
	  I verified through sip debug output that Asterisk properly ACKed
	  the 487 received from the Polycom. For my second test, I set up a
	  SIPp UAS scenario so that it would send a 200 OK in response to a
	  CANCEL but would not send a 487 for the original INVITE. I
	  verified that after about 40 seconds, Asterisk properly cleans up
	  the outgoing sip_pvt for the call. Review:

2009-07-10 16:23 +0000 [r205804]  David Vossel <dvossel@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: SIP registration auth loop caused by stale
	  nonce If an endpoint sends two registration requests in a very
	  short period of time with the same nonce, both receive 401
	  responses from Asterisk, each with a different nonce (the second
	  401 containing the current nonce and the first one being stale).
	  If the endpoint responds to the first 401, it does not match the
	  current nonce so Asterisk sends a third 401 with a newly
	  generated nonce (which updates the current nonce)... Now if the
	  endpoint responds to the second 401, it does not match the
	  current nonce either and Asterisk sends a fourth 401 with a newly
	  generated nonce... This loop goes on and on. There appears to be
	  a simple fix for this. If the nonce from the request does not
	  match our nonce, but is a good response to a previous nonce,
	  instead of sending a 401 with a newly generated nonce, use the
	  current one instead. This breaks the loop as the nonce is not
	  updated until a response is received. Additional logic has been
	  added to make sure no nonce can be responded to twice though.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a problem where chan_sip would ignore

	  long time that would manifest when Asterisk would send multiple
	  SIP responses on the same dialog before receiving a response. The
	  problem occurred because chan_sip only kept track of the highest
	  outgoing sequence number used on the dialog. If Asterisk sent two
	  requests out, and a response arrived for the first request sent,
	  then Asterisk would ignore the response. The result was that
	  Asterisk would continue retransmitting the requests and ignoring
	  the responses until the maximum number of retransmissions had
	  been reached. The fix here is to rearrange the code a bit so that
	  instead of simply comparing the sequence number of the response
	  to our latest outgoing sequence number, we walk our list of
	  outstanding packets and determine if there is a match. If there
	  is, we continue. If not, then we ignore the response. In doing
	  this, I found a few completely useless variables that I have now
	  removed. (closes issue #11231) Reported by: flefoll Review:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove an extra debug line left from
	  previous commit.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a situation in which Asterisk would not
	  stop retransmitting 487s. If a CANCEL were received by Asterisk,
	  we would send a 487 in response to the original INVITE and a 200
	  OK for the CANCEL. If there were a network hiccup which caused
	  the 200 OK and the 487 to be lost, then the UA communicating with
	  Asterisk may try to retransmit its CANCEL. Asterisk's response to
	  this used to be to try sending another 487 to the canceled INVITE
	  and another 200 OK to the CANCEL. The problem here is that the
	  originally-sent 487 was sent "reliably" meaning that it will be
	  retransmitted until it is received properly. So when we receive
	  the second CANCEL it is likely that the first batch of 487s we
	  sent is still going strong and reaches the UA. The result was
	  that the second set of 487s would be retransmitted constantly
	  until the maximum number of retries had been reached. The fix for
	  this is that if we receive a second CANCEL for an INVITE, then we
	  cancel the retransmission of the first set of 487s and start a
	  second set. This causes the dialog to be terminated reasonably.

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Fix memory corruption and leakage related
	  reloads of non files mode MoH classes. For Music on Hold classes
	  that are not files mode, meaning that we are executing an

	  monitor the external application and read audio from it. This
	  thread also makes use of the MoH class object. In the MoH class
	  destructor, we used pthread_cancel() to ask the thread to exit.
	  Unfortunately, the code did not wait to ensure that the thread
	  actually went away. What needed to be done is a pthread_join() to
	  ensure that the thread fully cleans up before we proceed. By
	  adding this one line, we resolve two significant problems: 1)
	  Since the thread was never joined, it never fully goes away. So,
	  on every reload of non-files mode MoH, an unused thread was
	  sticking around. 2) There was a race condition here where the
	  application monitoring thread could still try to access the MoH
	  class, even though the thread executing the MoH reload has
	  already destroyed it. (issue #15109) Reported by: jvandal (issue

	* main/asterisk.c, main/loader.c, include/asterisk.h: Safely handle
	  AMI connections/reload requests that occur during startup. During
	  asterisk startup, a lock on the list of modules is obtained by
	  the primary thread while each module is initialized. Issue 13778
	  pointed out a problem with this approach, however. Because the
	  AMI is loaded before other modules, it is possible for a module
	  reload to be issued by a connected client (via Action: Command),
	  causing a deadlock. The resolution for 13778 was to move
	  initialization of the manager to happen after the other modules
	  had already been lodaded. While this fixed this particular issue,
	  it caused a problem for users (like FreePBX) who call AMI scripts
	  via an #exec in a configuration file (See issue 15189). The
	  solution I have come up with is to defer any reload requests that
	  come in until after the server is fully booted. When a call comes
	  in to ast_module_reload (from wherever) before we are fully
	  booted, the request is added to a queue of pending requests. Once
	  we are done booting up, we then execute these deferred requests
	  in turn. Note that I have tried to make this a bit more
	  intelligent in that it will not queue up more than 1 request for
	  the same module to be reloaded, and if a general reload request
	  comes in ('module reload') the queue is flushed and we only issue
	  a single deferred reload for the entire system. As for how this
	  will impact existing installations - Before 13778, a reload
	  issued before module initialization was completed would result in
	  a deadlock. After 13778, you simply couldn't connect to the
	  manager during startup (which causes problems with
	  #exec-that-calls-AMI configuration files). I believe this is a
	  good general purpose solution that won't negatively impact
	  existing installations. (closes issue #15189) (closes issue

	  negative case and sets the ms to zero. A similar check is already
	  done right below this one in the 'else' statement. (closes issue

	  commit prevents cdr records with AST_CDR_FLAG_ANSLOCKED and
	  AST_CDR_FLAG_LOCKED from being updated in certain cases. This is
	  accomplished by adding two functions to update the answer time
	  and disposition of calls that checks for the proper lock flags.
	  These functions are used in the ast_bridge_call() function so
	  that ForkCDR(A) calls are respected. This patch also modifies the
	  way ast_bridge_call() chooses the cdr record to base the
	  bridged_cdr on. Previously the first unlocked cdr record would be
	  chosen, now instead the first cdr record is chosen and forked cdr
	  records are moved to the bridge_cdr. This allows the original cdr
	  record and any forked cdr records to be properly updated with
	  answer and end times. (closes issue #13797) Reported by: sh0t

	  received a provisional response for our INVITE). Note that this

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Move 300 bytes around on the stack, to make

	  extensions to be copied for a single voicemail, without creating
	  a possibility of upsetting existing users, where a dialplan could
	  run out of stack space where it had run fine before.
	  Alternatively, we could have allocated off the heap, but that is
	  a larger change and would have increased the chance for
	  instability introduced by this change. This is really solved
	  starting in 1.6.0.11, as the use of an ast_str buffer allows an
	  unlimited number of extensions (up to available memory). We
	  additionally create a new warning message when the buffer length
	  is exceeded, permitting administrators to see an issue after the
	  fact, whereas previously the list was silently truncated. (closes

	  calling context. Previously, someone complained about the
	  behavior as it related to the interior of a Gosub routine, and
	  the fix (#14011) inadvertently broke FreePBX (#14940). This
	  change should fix both of these situations, but with the possible

	  previously gone immediately to the "i" extension, but will now

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fixed autologoff in agents.conf not
	  working when agent logs in via AgentLogin app An agent logs in by
	  calling an extension that calls the AgentLogin app. In

	  have the choice to either acknowledge it or ignore it.
	  autologoff=10 is set as well, so if the agent ignores the call
	  over 10sec one may assume that the agent should be logged out
	  (and in this case hungup on as well), but this was not happening.

	* main/channel.c: Make a couple of changes with regards to a new
	  message printed in ast_read(). "ast_read() called with no

	  that potentially make such calls to ast_read() and trigger this
	  error message to be displayed. This commit does two things to
	  help to make this message appear less. First, the message has
	  been downgraded to a debug level message if dev mode is not
	  enabled. The message means a lot more to developers than it does
	  to end users, and so developers should take an effort to be sure
	  to call ast_read only when a channel is ready to be read from.
	  However, since this doesn't actually cause an error in operation
	  and is not something a user can easily fix, we should not spam
	  their console with these messages. Second, the message has been
	  moved to after the check for any pending masquerades. ast_read()
	  being called with no recorded file descriptor should not
	  interfere with a masquerade taking place. This could be seen as a
	  simple way of resolving issue #14723. However, I still want to
	  try to clear out the existing ways of triggering this message,
	  since I feel that would be a better resolution for the issue.

	* cdr/cdr_radius.c: Fix a memory leak in cdr_radius. I came across
	  this while doing some testing of my ast_channel_ao2 branch. After
	  running a test overnight that generated over 5 million calls,
	  Asterisk had taken up about 1 GB of my system memory. So, I
	  re-ran the test with MALLOC_DEBUG turned on. However, it showed
	  no leaks in Asterisk during the test, even though Asterisk was
	  still consuming it somehow. Instead, I turned to valgrind, which
	  when run with --leak-check=full, told me exactly where the leak
	  came from, which was from allocations inside the radiusclient-ng
	  library. This explains why MALLOC_DEBUG did not report it. After
	  a bit of analysis, I found that we were leaking a little bit of
	  memory every time a CDR record was passed to cdr_radius. I don't
	  actually have a radius server set up to receive CDR records.
	  However, I always have my development systems compile and install
	  all modules. In addition to making sure there are not build
	  errors across modules, always loading modules helps find bugs
	  like this, too, so it is strongly recommend for all developers.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fixes issue with dropped calles due to
	  re-Invite glare and re-Invites never executing after a 491
	  Acknowledgement for 491 responses were never being processed
	  because it didn't match our pending invite's seqno. Since the ACK
	  was never processed, the 491 frame would continue to be
	  retransmitted until eventually the call was dropped due to max
	  retries. Now during a pending invite, if we receive another
	  invite, we send an 491 and hold on to that glare invite's seqno
	  in the "glareinvite" variable for that sip_pvt struct. When ACK's
	  are received, we first check to see if it is in response to our
	  pending invite, if not we check to see if it is in response to a
	  glare invite. In this case, it is in response to the glare invite
	  and must be dealt with or the call is dropped. I've changed the
	  wait time for resending the re-Invite after receving a 491
	  response to comply with RFC 3261. Before this patch the scheduled
	  re-Invite would only change a flag indicating that the re-Invite
	  should be sent out, now it actually sends it out as well. (closes

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c: Fix incorrect parsing in chan_gtalk when
	  xmpp contains extra whitespaces To drill into the xmpp to find
	  the capabilities between channels, chan_gtalk calls iks_child()
	  and iks_next(). iks_child() and iks_next() are functions in the
	  iksemel xml parsing library that traverse xml nodes. The bug here
	  is that both iks_child() and iks_next() will return the next
	  iks_struct node *regardless* of type. chan_gtalk expects the next
	  node to be of type IKS_TAG, which in most cases, it is, but in
	  this case (a call being made from the Empathy IM client), there
	  exists iks_struct nodes which are not IKS_TAG data (they are
	  extraneous whitespaces), and chan_gtalk doesn't handle that case,
	  so capabilities don't match, and a call cannot be made.
	  iks_first_tag() and iks_next_tag(), on the other hand, will not
	  return the very next iks_struct, but will check to see if the
	  next iks_struct is of type IKS_TAG. If it isn't, it will be
	  skipped, and the next struct of type IKS_TAG it finds will be
	  returned. This assures that chan_gtalk will find the iks_struct
	  it is looking for. This fix simply changes all calls to
	  iks_child() and iks_next() to become calls to iks_first_tag() and
	  iks_next_tag(), which resolves the capability matching. The
	  following is a payload listing from Empathy, which, due to the
	  extraneous whitespace, will not be parsed correctly by iksemel:

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix queue weight behavior so that calls in
	  low-weight queues are not inappropriately blocked. (This is
	  copied and pasted from the review request I made for this patch)
	  Asterisk has some odd behavior when queue weights are used. The
	  current logic used when potentially calling a queue member is: If
	  the member we are going to call is part of another queue and
	  _that other queue has any callers in it_ and has a higher weight
	  than the queue we are calling from, then don't try to contact
	  that member. The issue here is what I have marked with
	  underscores. If the higher-weighted queue has any callers in it
	  at all, then the queue member will be unreachable from the
	  lower-weighted queue. This has the potential to be really really
	  bad if using a queue strategy, such as leastrecent or
	  fewestcalls, with the potential to call the same member
	  repeatedly. The fix proposed by garychen on issue 13220 is very
	  simple and, as far as I can see, works well for this situation.
	  With this set of changes, the logic used becomes: If the member
	  we are going to call is part of another queue, the other queue
	  has a higher weight than the queue we are calling from, and the
	  higher weight queue has at least as many callers as available
	  members, then do not try to contact the queue member. If the
	  higher weighted queue has fewer callers than available members,
	  then there is no reason to deny the call to this member since the
	  other queue can afford to spare a member. Since the fix involved
	  writing a generic function for determining the number of
	  available members in the queue, I also modified the is_our_turn
	  function to make use of the new num_available_members function to
	  determine if it is our turn to try calling a member. There is one
	  small behavior change. Before writing this patch, if you had
	  autofill disabled, then if you were the head caller in a queue,
	  you would automatically be told that it was your turn to try
	  calling a member. This did not take into account whether there
	  were actually any queue members available to take the call. Now
	  we actually make sure there is at least one member available to
	  take the call if autofill is disabled. (closes issue #13220)

	  be. We have seen a number of problems caused by poll() not
	  working properly on Mac OSX. If you search around, you'll find a
	  number of references to using select() instead of poll() to work
	  around these issues. In Asterisk, we've had poll.c which
	  implements poll() using select() internally. However, we were
	  still getting reports of problems. vadim investigated a bit and
	  realized that at least on his system, even though we were
	  compiling in poll.o, the system poll() was still being used. So,
	  the primary purpose of this patch is to ensure that we're using
	  the internal poll() when we want it to be used. The changes are:
	  1) Remove logic for when internal poll should be used from the
	  Makefile. Instead, put it in the configure script. The logic in
	  the configure script is the same as it was in the Makefile.
	  Ideally, we would have a functionality test for the problem, but
	  that's not actually possible, since we would have to be able to
	  run an application on the _target_ system to test poll()
	  behavior. 2) Always include poll.o in the build, but it will be
	  empty if AST_POLL_COMPAT is not defined. 3) Change uses of poll()
	  throughout the source tree to ast_poll(). I feel that it is good
	  practice to give the API call a new name when we are changing its
	  behavior and not using the system version directly in all cases.
	  So, normally, ast_poll() is just redefined to poll(). On systems
	  where AST_POLL_COMPAT is defined, ast_poll() is redefined to
	  ast_internal_poll(). 4) Change poll() in main/poll.c to be
	  ast_internal_poll(). It's worth noting that any code that still
	  uses poll() directly will work fine (if they worked fine before).
	  So, for example, out of tree modules that are using poll() will
	  not stop working or anything. However, for modules to work
	  properly on Mac OSX, ast_poll() needs to be used. (closes issue

	  any duplicates after the first box. Whether searchcontexts is
	  enabled or not, if we come across a duplicate mailbox in the same

	  mailbox. I have also added a small note to voicemail.conf.sample

2009-03-02 23:34 +0000 [r179532]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Move ast_waitfor() down to avoid the results
	  of the API call becoming stale. This call to ast_waitfor() was
	  being done way too soon in this section of code. Specifically,
	  there was code in between the call to waitfor and the code that
	  uses the result that puts the channel in autoservice. By putting
	  the channel in autoservice, the previous results of ast_waitfor()
	  become meaningless, as the autoservice thread will do it's own
	  ast_waitfor() and ast_read() on the channel. So, when we came
	  back out of autoservice and eventually hit the block of code that
	  calls ast_read() on the channel, there may not actually be any
	  input on the channel available. Even though the previous call to
	  ast_waitfor() in app_meetme said there was input, the autoservice
	  thread has since serviced the channel for some period of time.
	  This bug manifested itself while dvossel was doing some testing
	  of MeetMe in Asterisk trunk. He was using the timerfd timing
	  module. When the code hit ast_read() erroneously, it determined
	  that it must have been called because of input on the timer fd,
	  as chan->fdno was set to AST_TIMING_FD, since that was the cause
	  of the last legitimate call to ast_read() done by autoservice. In
	  this test, an IAX2 channel was calling into the MeetMe
	  conference. It was _much_ more likely to be seen with an IAX2
	  channel because of the way audio is handled. Every audio frame
	  that comes in results in a call to ast_queue_frame(), which then
	  uses ast_timer_enable_continuous() to notify the channel thread
	  that a frame is waiting to be handled. So, the chances of
	  ast_waitfor() indicating that a channel needs servicing due to a
	  timer event on an IAX2 event is very high. Finally, it is
	  interesting to note that if a different timing interface was
	  being used, this bug would probably not be noticed. When
	  ast_read() is called and erroneously thinks that there is a timer
	  event to handle, it calls the ast_timer_ack() function. The
	  pthread and dahdi timing modules handle the ack() function being
	  called when there is no event by simply ignoring it. In the case
	  of the timerfd module, it results in a read() on the timer fd
	  that will block forever, as there is no data to read. This caused
	  Asterisk to lock up very quickly. Thanks to dvossel and
	  mmichelson for the fun debugging session. :-)

	  distracted phone users in phone booths; kpfleming put his foot
	  down at 1.0 sec. Users who found the previous default max delay
	  of 250 msec perfect, are welcome to override the new default.
	  Notice that I said that 250 msec was the default; wait a minute,
	  you might say, the config file said it was 500 msec!; well,
	  because of the bug fix for 14515, we found that 500 msec was
	  actually enforcing a max of 250. The bug fix would restore 500

	* res/res_features.c: This patch prevents the feature detection
	  timeout from being cut in half. Because the ast_channel_bridge()
	  call will return 0 and pass a frame pointer for both DTMF_BEGIN

	  getting decremented twice, which effectively cuts the

	  only let DTMF_END frames to flow thru, which solved the problem.
	  Also, when the frame pointer is null, let control flow thru--
	  this usually happens on timeouts. I added a comment to the code

	* pbx/ael/ael.tab.c, pbx/ael/ael.y: This patch fixes a regression
	  of sorts that was introduced in rev 24425. It basically fixes
	  AST-190/ABE-1782. What was wrong: the user has 6000 extensions in
	  one context; and then 6000 contexts, one per extension. The
	  parser could only handle about 4893 of the 6000 extens in the
	  single context. This was due to the regression I mentioned. To
	  get rid of shift/reduce conflicts, Luigi set up right-recursive
	  lists for globals, context elements, switch lists, and
	  statements. Right recursive lists got rid of the warnings, but
	  instead, they use up a tremendous amount of stack space when the
	  lists are long. I saw this a few years back, and resolved not to
	  fix it until someone complained. That day has arrived! After the
	  changes were made, I ran the regression test suite, and there
	  were no problems. I took the test case the user provided, and
	  added 100,000 extensions to the single context, that already had
	  6,000 extens in it. (I'll see your 6, and raise you 100!) It
	  takes a few minutes to read it all in, check it and generate code
	  for it, but no problems. So, I think I can say that
	  fundamentally, there are no longer any limits on the number of
	  items you can place in contexts, statement blocks, switches, or
	  globals, beyond your virt mem constraints.

	* main/rtp.c: Don't send DTMF for infinite time if we do not
	  receive an END event. I thought that this was going to end up
	  being a pretty gnarly fix, but it turns out that there was
	  actually already a configuration option in rtp.conf, dtmftimeout,
	  that was intended to handle this situation. However, in between
	  Asterisk 1.2 and Asterisk 1.4, the code that processed the option
	  got lost. So, this commit brings it back to life. The default
	  timeout is 3 seconds. However, it is worth noting that having
	  this be configurable at all is not really the recommended
	  behavior in RFC 2833. From Section 3.5 of RFC 2833: Limiting the
	  time period of extending the tone is necessary to avoid that a
	  tone "gets stuck". Regardless of the algorithm used, the tone
	  SHOULD NOT be extended by more than three packet interarrival
	  times. A slight extension of tone durations and shortening of
	  pauses is generally harmless. Three seconds will pretty much
	  _always_ be far more than three packet interarrival times.
	  However, that behavior is not required, so I'm going to leave it
	  with our legacy behavior for now. Code from

	* apps/app_mixmonitor.c: Add some missing cleanup to app_mixmonitor

	* apps/app_mixmonitor.c: Fix a problem where a channel pointer
	  becomes invalid due to masquerading or hanging up. app_mixmonitor
	  runs its own thread to monitor the channel's activity and write
	  the mixed audio to a file. Since this thread runs independently
	  of the channel, it is possible that the mixmonitor thread's
	  channel pointer will point to freed memory when the channel
	  either is masqueraded or hangs up (technically, both cases are
	  hangups, but we need to handle the cases slightly differently).
	  The solution for this is to employ a datastore, which has the
	  nice benefit of allowing us to hook into channel masquerades and
	  hangups and update our pointer as necessary. If this looks
	  familiar, this same technique is employed in app_chanspy.
	  app_chanspy is a bit more involved since it does a lot more
	  operations on the channel that is being spied upon.
	  app_mixmonitor does have an extra touch that app_chanspy doesn't
	  have, though. Since there is a thread race between the channel's
	  thread and the mixmonitor thread on a hangup, we em- ploy a
	  condition-and-boolean combination to ensure that the channel
	  thread finishes with our structure before the mixmonitor thread
	  attempts to free it. No crashes! (closes issue #14374) Reported

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fixes issue with IAX2 transfer not handing

	  stored in a hash table. The hash table, "iax_peercallno_pvt",
	  storing all the current call numbers did not take into account
	  the complications associated with transferring a call, so a
	  separate hash table was required. This second hash table
	  "iax_transfercallno_pvt" handles calls being transfered, once the
	  call transfer is complete the call is removed from the transfer
	  hash table and added to the peer hash table resuming normal
	  operations. Addition functions were created to handle storing,
	  removing, and comparing items in the iax_transfercallno_pvt

	  CHANGES: Fix feature inheritance with builtin features When using
	  builtin features like parking and transfers, the AST_FEATURE_*
	  flags would not be set correctly for all instances when either
	  performing a builtin attended transfer, or parking a call and
	  getting the timeout callback. Also, there was no way on a
	  per-call basis to specify what features someone should have on
	  picking up a parked call (since that doesn't involve the Dial()
	  command). There was a global option for setting whether or not
	  all users who pickup a parked call should have
	  AST_FEATURE_REDIRECT set, but nothing for DISCONNECT, AUTOMON, or
	  PARKCALL. This patch: 1) adds the BRIDGE_FEATURES dialplan
	  variable which can be set either in the dialplan or with setvar
	  in channels that support it. This variable can be set to any
	  combination of 't', 'k', 'w', and 'h' (case insensitive matching
	  of the equivalent dial options), to set what features should be
	  activated on this channel. The patch moves the setting of the
	  features datastores into the bridging code instead of app_dial to
	  help facilitate this. 2) adds global options parkedcallparking,
	  parkedcallhangup, and parkedcallrecording to be similar to the
	  parkedcalltransfers option for globally setting features. 3) has
	  builtin_atxfer call builtin_parkcall if being transfered to the
	  parking extension since tracking everything through multiple
	  masquerades, etc. is difficult and error-prone 4) attempts to fix
	  all cases of return calls from parking and completed builtin

	  include/asterisk/channel.h, AST_FLAG_BRIDGE_HANGUP_DONT, which
	  used as a messenge to the bridge hangup exten code not to run the
	  h-exten there (nor publish the bridge cdr there). It will done at
	  the pbx-loop level instead. 2. In the manager Redirect code, I
	  set this flag on the channel if the channel has a non-null pbx
	  pointer. I did the same for the second (chan2) channel, which
	  gets run if name2 is set... and the first succeeds. 3. I restored
	  the ending of the cdr for the pbx loop h-exten running code.
	  Don't know why it was removed in the first place. 4. The first
	  attempt at the fix for this bug was to place code directly in the
	  async_goto routine, which was called from a large number of
	  places, and could affect a large number of cases, so I tested
	  that fix against a fair number of transfer scenarios, both with
	  and without the patch. In the process, I saw that putting the fix
	  in async_goto seemed not to affect any of the blind or attended
	  scenarios, but still, I was was highly concerned that some other
	  scenarios I had not tested might be negatively impacted, so I
	  refined the patch to its current scope, and jmls tested both. In
	  the process, tho, I saw that blind xfers in one situation, when
	  the one-touch blind-xfer feature is used by the peer, we got
	  strange h-exten behavior. So, I inserted code to swap CDRs and to
	  set the HANGUP_DONT field, to get uniform behavior. 5. I added
	  code to the bridge to obey the HANGUP_DONT flag, skipping both
	  publishing the bridge CDR, and running the h-exten; they will be
	  done at the pbx-loop (higher) level instead. 6. I removed all the
	  debug logs from the patch before committing. 7. I moved the
	  AUTOLOOP set/reset in the h-exten code in res_features so it's
	  only done if the h-exten is going to be run. A very minor
	  performance improvement, but technically correct. (closes issue

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fix devicestate problems for "always-on"
	  agent channels A revision to chan_agent attempted to "inherit"
	  the device state of the underlying channel in order to report the
	  device state of an agent channel more accurately. The problem
	  with the logic here is that it makes no sense to use this for
	  always-on agents. If the agent is logged in, then to the
	  underlying channel, the agent will always appear to be "in use,"
	  no matter if the agent is on a call or not. The reason is that to
	  the underlying channel, the channel is currently in use on a call
	  to the AgentLogin application. The most common cause that I found
	  for this issue to occur was for a SIP channel to be the
	  underlying channel type for an Agent channel. If the SIP phone
	  re-registers, then the registration will cause the device state
	  core to query the device state of the SIP channel. Since the SIP
	  channel is in use, the Agent channel would also inherit this
	  status. Once the agent channel was set to "in use" there was no
	  way that the device state could change on that channel unless the
	  agent logged out. The solution for this problem is a bit
	  different in 1.4 than it is in the other branches. In 1.4, there
	  will be a one-line fix to make sure that only callback agents
	  will inherit device state from their underlying channel type. For
	  the other branches of Asterisk, since callback support has been
	  removed, there is also no need for device state inheritance in
	  chan_agent, so I will simply be removing it from the code. In
	  addition, the 1.4 source is getting a new comment to help the
	  next person who edits chan_agent.c. I'm adding a comment that a
	  agent_pvt's loginchan field may be used to determine if the agent
	  is a callback agent or not. (closes issue #14173) Reported by:

	* main/slinfactory.c: Prevent a crash from occurring when a jitter

	  slinfactory used the "samples" field of an ast_frame in order to
	  determine the amount of data contained within the frame. In
	  certain cases, such as jitter buffer interpolated frames, the
	  frame would have a non-zero value for "samples" but have NULL
	  "data" This caused a problem when a memcpy call in
	  ast_slinfactory_read would attempt to access invalid memory. The
	  solution in use here is to never feed frames into the slinfactory
	  if they have NULL "data" (closes issue #13116) Reported by:

	* channels/chan_sip.c: A couple of changes to T.38 SDP attribute
	  handling There are some boolean attributes for T.38 such as
	  T38FaxFillBitRemoval, T38FaxTranscodingMMR, and
	  T38FaxTranscodingJBIG. By simply being present, we should treat
	  these as a "true" value. The current code, however, was requiring
	  a 1 or 0 as the value of the attribute in order to parse it. This
	  is due to the fact that there are some T.38 endpoints and
	  gateways that also transmit this information incorrectly. This
	  patch follows the "be liberal in what you accept and strict in
	  what you send" philosophy by accepting both the correctly- and
	  incorrectly-formatted attributes, but only sending information as
	  it is supposed to be sent. It was also discovered that a
	  particular type of T.38 gateway sends some non-standard T.38 SDP
	  attributes. Instead of using T38FaxMaxDatagram and T38MaxBitRate,
	  it used T38MaxDatagram and T38FaxMaxRate respectively. We now
	  will properly accept these attributes as well. Note that there
	  are a lot of patches cited in the below commit message template.
	  This is because the person who submitted these patches is an
	  awesome person and wrote 1.4, 1.6.0, and 1.6.1 variants. (closes

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c: Fix a deadlock relating to channel locks
	  and autoservice It has been discovered that if a channel is
	  locked prior to a call to ast_autoservice_stop, then it is likely
	  that a deadlock will occur. The reason is that the call to
	  ast_autoservice_stop has a check built into it to be sure that
	  the thread running autoservice is not currently trying to
	  manipulate the channel we are about to pull out of autoservice.
	  The autoservice thread, however, cannot advance beyond where it
	  currently is, though, because it is trying to acquire the lock of
	  the channel for which autoservice is attempting to be stopped.
	  The gist of all this is that a channel MUST NOT be locked when
	  attempting to stop autoservice on the channel. In this particular
	  case, the channel was locked by a call to ast_read. A call to
	  ast_exists_extension led to autoservice being started and stopped
	  due to the existence of dialplan switches. It may be that there
	  are future commits which handle the same symptoms but in a
	  different location, but based on my looks through the code, it is
	  very rare to see a construct such as this one. (closes issue

	* apps/app_dial.c, res/res_features.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h,
	  apps/app_queue.c: This merges the masqpark branch into 1.4 These
	  changes eliminate the need for (and use of) the KEEPALIVE return
	  code in res_features.c; There are other places that use this
	  result code for similar purposes at a higher level, these appear
	  to be left alone in 1.4, but attacked in trunk. The reason these
	  changes are being made in 1.4, is that parking ends a channel's
	  life, in some situations, and the code in the bridge (and some
	  other places), was not checking the result code properly, and
	  dereferencing the channel pointer, which could lead to memory
	  corruption and crashes. Calling the masq_park function eliminates
	  this danger in higher levels. A series of previous commits have
	  replaced some parking calls with masq_park, but this patch puts
	  them ALL to rest, (except one, purposely left alone because a
	  masquerade is done anyway), and gets rid of the code that tests
	  the KEEPALIVE result, and the NOHANGUP_PEER result codes. While
	  bug 13820 inspired this work, this patch does not solve all the
	  problems mentioned there. I have tested this patch (again) to
	  make sure I have not introduced regressions. Crashes that
	  occurred when a parked party hung up while the parking party was
	  listening to the numbers of the parking stall being assigned, is
	  eliminated. These are the cases where parking code may be
	  activated: 1. Feature one touch (eg. *3) 2. Feature blind xfer to
	  parking lot (eg ##700) 3. Run Park() app from dialplan (eg sip
	  xfer to 700) (eg. dahdi hookflash xfer to 700) 4. Run Park via
	  manager. The interesting testing cases for parking are: I. A
	  calls B, A parks B a. B hangs up while A is getting the numbers
	  announced. b. B hangs up after A gets the announcement, but
	  before the parking time expires c. B waits, time expires, A is
	  redialed, A answers, B and A are connected, after which, B hangs
	  up. d. C picks up B while still in parking lot. II. A calls B, B
	  parks A a. A hangs up while B is getting the numbers announced.
	  b. A hangs up after B gets the announcement, but before the
	  parking time expires c. A waits, time expires, B is redialed, B
	  answers, A and B are connected, after which, A hangs up. d. C
	  picks up A while still in parking lot. Testing this throroughly
	  involves acting all the permutations of I and II, in situations
	  1,2,3, and 4. Since I added a few more changes (ALL references to
	  KEEPALIVE in the bridge code eliimated (I missed one earlier), I
	  retested most of the above cases, and no crashes. H-extension
	  weirdness. Current h-extension execution is not completely
	  correct for several of the cases. For the case where A calls B,
	  and A parks B, the 'h' exten is run on A's channel as soon as the
	  park is accomplished. This is expected behavior. But when A calls
	  B, and B parks A, this will be current behavior: After B parks A,
	  B is hung up by the system, and the 'h' (hangup) exten gets run,
	  but the channel mentioned will be a derivative of A's... Thus, if
	  A is DAHDI/1, and B is DAHDI/2, the h-extension will be run on
	  channel Parked/DAHDI/1-1<ZOMBIE>, and the start/answer/end info
	  will be those relating to Channel A. And, in the case where A is
	  reconnected to B after the park time expires, when both parties
	  hang up after the joyful reunion, no h-exten will be run at all.
	  In the case where C picks up A from the parking lot, when either
	  A or C hang up, the h-exten will be run for the C channel. CDR's
	  are a separate issue, and not addressed here. As to WHY this
	  strange behavior occurs, the answer lies in the procedure
	  followed to accomplish handing over the channel to the parking
	  manager thread. This procedure is called masquerading. In the
	  process, a duplicate copy of the channel is created, and most of
	  the active data is given to the new copy. The original channel
	  gets its name changed to XXX<ZOMBIE> and keeps the PBX
	  information for the sake of the original thread (preserving its
	  role as a call originator, if it had this role to begin with),
	  while the new channel is without this info and becomes a call
	  target (a "peer"). In this case, the parking lot manager thread
	  is handed the new (masqueraded) channel. It will not run an
	  h-exten on the channel if it hangs up while in the parking lot.
	  The h exten will be run on the original channel instead, in the
	  original thread, after the bridge completes. See bug 13820 for
	  our intentions as to how to clean up the h exten behavior.

	* main/channel.c, res/res_features.c: Handle a case where a call
	  can be bridged to a channel that is still ringing. The issue that
	  was reported was about a case where a RINGING channel got
	  redirected to an extension to pick up a call from parking. Once
	  the parked call got taken out of parking, it heard silence until
	  the other side answered. Ideally, the caller that was parked
	  would get a ringing indication. This patch fixes this case so
	  that the caller receives ringback once it comes out of parking
	  until the other side answers. The fixes are: - Make sure we
	  remember that a channel was an outgoing channel when doing a
	  masquerade. This prevents an erroneous ast_answer() call on the
	  channel, which causes a bogus 200 OK to be sent in the case of
	  SIP. - Add some additional comments to explain related parts of
	  code. - Update the handling of the ast_channel visible_indication
	  field. Storing values that are not stateful is pointless. Control
	  frames that are events or commands should be ignored. - When a
	  bridge first starts, check to see if the peer channel needs to be
	  given ringing indication because the calling side is still
	  ringing. - Rework ast_indicate_data() a bit for the sake of
	  readability. (closes issue #13747) Reported by: davidw Tested by:

	  autoservice to put digits on the head of the channel's frame
	  readq instead of the tail. If there were frames on the readq that
	  autoservice had not yet read, the previous code would have
	  resulted in out of order processing. This required a new API call
	  to queue a frame to the head of the queue instead of the tail. 2)
	  Change up the processing of DTMF in ast_read(). Some of the
	  problems were the result of having two sources of pending DTMF
	  frames. There was the dtmfq and the more generic readq. Both were
	  used for pending DTMF in various scenarios. Simplifying things to
	  only use the frame readq avoids some of the problems. 3) Fix a
	  bug where a DTMF END frame could get passed through when it
	  shouldn't have. If code set END_DTMF_ONLY in the middle of digit
	  emulation, and a digit arrived before emulation was complete,
	  digits would get processed out of order. (closes issue #12658)

	  Reported by: wetwired Tested by: murf I checked, and I added a
	  mod to the trunk version of Asterisk that would make it 8-bit
	  transparent on 27 Nov 2007, but I made no such updates to 1.4. My
	  best guess is that 1.4 was released, and it was not appropriate
	  to commit an enhancement. But I'm going to add the same fixes to
	  1.4 now, for the following reasons: 1. wetwired is correct; 1.4
	  is **mostly** 8-bit transparent now. This is because the lexical
	  token forming rules use . in most 'word' state continuances. It's
	  just the beginning of a 'word' that is picky. 2. Accepting 8-bit
	  chars in some places and not others leads to bug reports like
	  this.

	  Patches: 14019.diff uploaded by murf (license 17) Tested by:
	  ckjohnsonme, murf This crash was the result of a few small errors
	  that would combine in 64-bit land to result in a crash. 32-bit
	  land might have seen these combine to mysteriously drop the args
	  to an application call, in certain circumstances. Also, in trying
	  to find this bug, I spotted a situation in the flex input, where,
	  in passing back a 'word' to the parser, it would allocate a
	  buffer larger than necessary. I changed the usage in such
	  situations, so that strdup was not used, but rather, an
	  ast_malloc, followed by ast_copy_string. I removed a field from
	  the pval struct, in u2, that was never getting used, and set in
	  one spot in the code. I believe it was an artifact of a previous
	  fix to make switch cases work invisibly with extens. And, for
	  goto's I removed a '!' from before a strcmp, that has been there
	  since the initial merging of AEL2, that might prevent the proper
	  target of a goto from being found. This was pretty harmless on
	  its own, as it would just louse up a consistency check for users.
	  Many thanks to ckjohnsonme for providing a simplified and
	  complete set of information about the bug, that helped
	  considerably in finding and fixing the problem. Now, to get
	  aelparse up and running again in trunk, and out of its "horribly
	  broken" state, so I can run the regression suite!

	  The previous code carried over group settings from the old

	  settings that were already on the new channel. This patch removes
	  all group settings that already existed on the new channel. I
	  have a more complicated version of this patch which addresses
	  only the most blatant problem with this, which is that a channel
	  can end up with multiple group settings in the same category.
	  However, I could not think of a use case for keeping any of the
	  group settings from the old channel, so I went this route for
	  now. (closes AST-152)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: During bridge code, the channel bridge may

	* pbx/pbx_spool.c: If an entry is added to the directory during a
	  scan when another entry expires, then that new entry will not be

	  exist in the directory (other than the new entries) when a bunch
	  expire, then the new entries must wait until another new entry is

	  change, if (and only if) --enable-dev-mode was used and

	  change adds an announce_thread responsible for playing

	  that I had to also have the corresponding options in the dial
	  command! Duh! (In all this time, I never set this up before!) So,
	  to keep some poor fool from suffering the same fate, I made the
	  features.conf.sample file mention the corresponding opts in
	  dial/queue; and the docs for dial/app specifically mention the
	  corresponding decls in the feature.conf file. I hope this doesn't
	  spoil some vast, eternal plan...

	* apps/app_dial.c, res/res_features.c, funcs/func_channel.c,
	  include/asterisk/pbx.h, apps/app_queue.c: The magic trick to
	  avoid this crash is not to try to find the channel by name in the
	  list, which is slow and resource consuming, but rather to pay
	  attention to the result codes from the ast_bridge_call, to which
	  I added the AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER_PARKED value, which now are
	  returned when a channel is parked. If you get AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE,
	  then don't touch the channel pointer. If you get
	  AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER, or AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER_PARKED, then
	  don't touch the peer pointer. Updated the several places where
	  the results from a bridge were not being properly obeyed, and
	  fixed some code I had introduced so that the results of the
	  bridge were not overridden (in trunk). All the places that
	  previously tested for AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER now have to check
	  for both AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER and
	  AST_PBX_NO_HANGUP_PEER_PARKED. I tested this against the 4 common
	  parking scenarios: 1. A calls B; B answers; A parks B; B hangs up
	  while A is getting the parking slot announcement, immediately
	  after being put on hold. 2. A calls B; B answers; A parks B; B
	  hangs up after A has been hung up, but before the park times out.
	  3. A calls B; B answers; B parks A; A hangs up while B is getting
	  the parking slot announcement, immediately after being put on
	  hold. 4. A calls B; B answers; B parks A; A hangs up after B has
	  been hung up, but before the park times out. No crash. I also ran
	  the scenarios above against valgrind, and accesses looked good.

	* main/asterisk.c: As per kpfleming's comments to the prior commit,

	  places in the code that check for: #if defined(HAVE_ZAPTEL) ||
	  defined(HAVE_DAHDI) Harmless, but still incorrect." In the case
	  of main/asterisk.c, this is not incorrect because without
	  HAVE_ZAPTEL defined, we're missing the include for ioctl and the
	  namespace that defines DAHDI_TIMERCONFIG which is still required
	  when using Zaptel with the 1.4 branch.

	  situation exactly the same way it was handled in pbx.c back on
	  r61766. We'll create a bogus channel for the function call and
	  destroy it when we're done. If we have trouble allocating the
	  bogus channel then we're not going to try executing the function

2008-10-16 15:26 +0000 [r150056]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* cdr/cdr_odbc.c: This patch is relevant to: ABE-1628 and
	  RYM-150398 and AST-103 in internal Digium bug trackers. These
	  fixes address a really subtle memory corruption problem that
	  would happen in machines heavily loaded in production
	  environments. The corruption would always take the form of the
	  STMT object getting nulled out and one of the unixODBC calls
	  would crash trying to access statement->connection. It isn't
	  fully proven yet, but the server has now been running 2.5 days
	  without appreciable memory growth, or any gain of %cpu, and no
	  crashes. Whether this is the problem or not on that server, these
	  fixes are still warranted. As it turns out, **I** introduced
	  these errors unwittingly, when I corrected another crash earlier.
	  I had formed the build_query routine, and failed to remove
	  mutex_unlock calls in 3 places in the transplanted code. These
	  unlocks would only happen in error situations, but unlocking the
	  mutex early set the code up for a catastrophic failure, it
	  appears. It would happen only once every 100K-200K or more calls,
	  under heavy load... but that is enough. If another crash occurs,
	  with the same MO, I'll come back and remove my confession from
	  the log, and we'll keep searching, but the fact that we have
	  Asterisk dying from an asynchronous wiping of the STMT object,
	  only on some connection error, and that the server has lived for
	  2.5 days on this code without a crash, sure make it look like
	  this was the problem! Also, in several points, Statement handles
	  are set to NULL after SQLFreeHandle. This was mainly for
	  insurance, to guarantee a crash. As it turns out, the code does
	  not appear to be attempting to use these freed pointers. Asterisk
	  owes a debt of gratitude to Federico Alves and Frediano Ziglio
	  for their untiring efforts in finding this bug, among others.

	  Reported by: yarns Tested by: murf If you find this message
	  overly verbose, relax, it's probably not meant for you. This
	  message is meant for probably only two people in the whole world:
	  me, or the poor schnook that has to maintain this code because
	  I'm either dead or unavailable at the moment. This fix solves two
	  reports, both having to do with embedding a function call in a
	  ${} construct. It was tricky because the funccall syntax has
	  parenthesis () in it. And up till now, the 'word' token in the
	  flex stuff didn't allow that, because it would tend to steal the
	  LP and RP tokens. To be truthful, the "word" token was the
	  trickiest, most unstable thing in the whole lexer. I was lucky it
	  made this long without complaints. I had to choose every
	  character in the pattern with extreme care, and I knew that
	  someday I'd have to revisit it. Well, the day has come. So, my
	  brilliant idea (and I'm being modest), was to use the surrounding
	  ${} construct to make a state machine and capture everything in
	  it, no matter what it contains. But, I have to now treat the word
	  token like I did with comments, in that I turn the whole thing
	  into a state-machine sort of spec, with new contexts
	  "curlystate", "wordstate", and "brackstate". Wait a minute,
	  "brackstate"? Yes, well, it didn't take very many regression
	  tests to point out if I do this for ${} constructs, I also have
	  to do it with the $[] constructs, too. I had to create a separate
	  pcbstack2 and pcbstack3 because these constructs can occur inside
	  macro argument lists, and when we have two state machines
	  operating on the same structures we'd get problems otherwise. I
	  guess I could have stopped at pcbstack2 and had the brackstate
	  stuff share it, but it doesn't hurt to be safe. So, the pcbpush
	  and pcbpop routines also now have versions for "2" and "3". I had
	  to add the {KEYWORD} construct to the initial pattern for "word",
	  because previously word would match stuff like "default7",
	  because it was a longer match than the keyword "default". But,
	  not any more, because the word pattern only matches only one or
	  two characters now, and it will always lose. So, I made it the
	  winner again by making an optional match on any of the keywords
	  before it's normal pattern. I added another regression test to
	  make sure we don't lose this in future edits, and had to fix just
	  one regression, where it no longer reports a 'cascaded' error,
	  which I guess is a plus. I've given some thought as to whether to
	  apply these fixes to 1.4 and the 1.6.x releases, vs trunk; I
	  decided to put it in 1.4 because one of the bug reports was
	  against 1.4; and it is unexpected that AEL cannot handle this
	  situation. It actually reduced the amount of useless "cascade"
	  error messages that appeared in the regressions (by one line,
	  ehhem). There is a possible side-effect in that it does now do
	  more careful checking of what's in those ${} constructs, as far
	  as matching parens, and brackets are concerned. Some users may
	  find a an insidious problem and correct it this way. This should
	  be exceedingly rare, I hope.

	* main/manager.c, apps/app_queue.c, channels/chan_iax2.c: After
	  working on the ao2_containers branch, I noticed something a bit
	  strange. In all cases where we provide a callback function to
	  ao2_container_alloc, the callback function would only return 0 or
	  CMP_MATCH. After inspecting the ao2_callback() code carefully, I
	  found that if you're only looking for one specific item, then you
	  should return CMP_MATCH | CMP_STOP. Otherwise, astobj2 will
	  continue traversing the current bucket until the end searching
	  for more matches. In cases like chan_iax2 where in 1.4, all the
	  peers are shoved into a single bucket, this makes for potentially
	  terrible performance since the entire bucket will be traversed
	  even if the peer is one of the first ones come across in the
	  bucket. All the changes I have made were for cases where the
	  callback function defined was passed to ao2_container_alloc so
	  that calls to ao2_find could find a unique instance of whatever
	  object was being stored in the container.

	  a newly scheduled task would not properly wake up the scheduler
	  or affect the wake up period. The order of execution would have
	  been: 1) Scheduler thread determines wake up time of N ms. 2)
	  Another thread schedules a task and signals the condition, with
	  an execution time of < N ms. 3) Scheduler thread locks and goes
	  to sleep for N ms. By moving the sleep time determination to
	  inside the critical section, this possibility is avoided.

	* main/pbx.c, res/res_features.c: (closes issue #13251) Reported
	  by: sergee Tested by: murf THis is a bold move for a static
	  release fix, but I wouldn't have made it if I didn't feel
	  confident (at least a *bit* confident) that it wouldn't mess
	  everyone up. The reasoning goes something like this: 1. We simply
	  cannot do anything with CDR's at the current point (in pbx.c,
	  after the __ast_pbx_run loop). It's way too late to have any
	  affect on the CDRs. The CDR is already posted and gone, and the
	  remnants have been cleared. 2. I was very much afraid that moving
	  the running of the 'h' extension down into the bridge code (where
	  it would be now practical to do it), would result in a lot more
	  calls to the 'h' exten, so I implemented it as another exten
	  under another name, but found, to my pleasant surprise, that
	  there was a 1:1 correspondence to the running of the 'h' exten in
	  the pbx_run loop, and the new spot at the end of the bridge. So,
	  I ifdef'd out the current 'h' loop, and moved it into the bridge
	  code. The only difference I can see is the stuff about the
	  AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE, and hopefully, if this is still an important
	  decision point, I can replicate it if there are complaints. To be
	  perfectly honest, the KEEPALIVE situation is not totally clear to
	  me, and how it relates to a post-bridge situation is less clear.
	  I suspect the users will point out everything in total clarity if
	  this steps on anyone's toes! 3. I temporarily swap the bridge_cdr
	  into the channel before running the 'h' exten, which makes it
	  possible for users to edit the cdr before it goes out the door.
	  And, of course, with the endbeforehexten config var set, the
	  users can also get at the billsec/duration vals. After the h
	  exten finishes, the cdr is swapped back and processing continues
	  as normal. Please, all who deal with CDR's, please test this
	  version of Asterisk, and file bug reports as appropriate!

	  datastore has already been removed in step 2, so the spyer
	  continues in the code. 4. The spyee's thread continues and calls
	  the datastore's destroy callback, chanspy_ds_destroy. This
	  involves locking the chanspy_ds. 5. Now the spyer attempts to
	  destroy the chanspy_ds lock. The problem is that in step 4, the
	  spyee has locked this lock, meaning that the spyer is attempting
	  to destroy a lock which is currently locked by another thread.
	  The backtrace provided in issue #12969 supports the idea that
	  this is possible (and has even occurred). This commit does not
	  close the issue, but should help in preventing one type of crash
	  associated with the use of app_chanspy.

	  be zero. Reloading the module is different in that the signalling

	  by: korihor Wow, this one was a challenge! I regrouped and ran a
	  new strategy for setting the ~~MACRO~~ value; I set it once per
	  extension, up near the top. It is only set if there is a switch
	  in the extension. So, I had to put in a chunk of code to detect a
	  switch in the pval tree. I moved the code to insert the set of
	  ~~exten~~ up to the beginning of the gen_prios routine, instead
	  of down in the switch code. I learned that I have to push the
	  detection of the switches down into the code, so everywhere I
	  create a new exten in gen_prios, I make sure to pass onto it the
	  values of the mother_exten first, and the exten next. I had to
	  add a couple fields to the exten struct to accomplish this, in
	  the ael_structs.h file. The checked field makes it so we don't
	  repeat the switch search if it's been done. I also updated the
	  regressions.

	* main/rtp.c, channels/chan_skinny.c: Since adding the

	  may not yet have an rtp structure allocated. This caused a crash
	  in chan_skinny, which was fixed earlier, but now the same crash
	  has been reported against chan_h323 as well. It seems that the
	  best solution is to modify ast_rtp_new_source to not attempt to
	  set the marker bit if the rtp structure passed in is NULL. This
	  change to ast_rtp_new_source also allows the removal of what is
	  now a redundant pointer check from chan_skinny. (closes issue

	  Merging the issue11259 branch. The purpose of this branch was to
	  take into account "burps" which could cause jitterbuffers to
	  misbehave. One such example is if the L option to Dial() were
	  used to inject audio into a bridged conversation at regular
	  intervals. Since the audio here was not passed through the
	  jitterbuffer, it would cause a gap in the jitterbuffer's
	  timestamps which would cause a frames to be dropped for a brief
	  period. Now ast_generic_bridge will empty and reset the
	  jitterbuffer each time it is called. This causes injected audio
	  to be handled properly. ast_generic_bridge also will empty and
	  reset the jitterbuffer if it receives an AST_CONTROL_SRCUPDATE
	  frame since the change in audio source could negatively affect
	  the jitterbuffer. All of this was made possible by adding a new
	  public API call to the abstract_jb called ast_jb_empty_and_reset.

	  Tested by: murf I discovered that also, in the previous bug fixes
	  and changes, the cdr.conf 'unanswered' option is not being
	  obeyed, so I fixed this. And, yes, there are two 'answer' times
	  involved in this scenario, and I would agree with you, that the
	  first answer time is the time that should appear in the CDR. (the
	  second 'answer' time is the time that the bridge was begun). I
	  made the necessary adjustments, recording the first answer time
	  into the peer cdr, and then using that to override the bridge
	  cdr's value. To get the 'unanswered' CDRs to appear, I purposely
	  output them, using the dial cmd to mark them as DIALED (with a
	  new flag), and outputting them if they bear that flag, and you
	  are in the right mode. I also corrected one small mention of the
	  Zap device to equally consider the dahdi device. I heavily tested
	  10-sec-wait macros in dial, and without the macro call; I tested
	  hangups while the macro was running vs. letting the macro
	  complete and the bridge form. Looks OK. Removed all the
	  instrumentation and debug.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: In a conversion to use ast_strlen_zero, the

	  reverts IAX2 to the original meaning, which was, that the
	  callerid set on the client should be overridden on the server,
	  even if that means the resulting callerid is blank. In other
	  words, if you set "callerid=" in the IAX config, then the
	  callerid should be overridden to blank, even if set on the
	  client. Note that there's a distinction, even on realtime,
	  between the field not existing (NULL in databases) and the field
	  existing, but set to blank (override callerid to blank).

	  Tested by: murf OK, a few days of debugging, a bunch of
	  instrumentation in chan_sip, main/channel.c, main/pbx.c, etc. and
	  5 solid notebook pages of notes later, I have made the small
	  tweek necc. to get the start time right on the second CDR when: A
	  Calls B B answ. A hits Xfer button on sip phone, A dials C and
	  hits the OK button, A hangs up C answers ringing phone B and C
	  converse B and/or C hangs up But does not harm the scenario
	  where: A Calls B B answ. B hits xfer button on sip phone, B dials
	  C and hits the OK button, B hangs up C answers ringing phone A
	  and C converse A and/or C hangs up The difference in start times
	  on the second CDR is because of a Masquerade on the B channel
	  when the xfer number is sent. It ends up replacing the CDR on the
	  B channel with a duplicate, which ends up getting tossed out. We
	  keep a pointer to the first CDR, and update *that* after the
	  bridge closes. But, only if the CDR has changed. I hope this
	  change is specific enough not to muck up any current CDR-based
	  apps. In my defence, I assert that the previous information was
	  wrong, and this change fixes it, and possibly other similar
	  scenarios. I wonder if I should be doing the same thing for the
	  channel, as I did for the peer, but I can't think of a scenario
	  this might affect. I leave it, then, as an exersize for the
	  users, to find the scenario where the chan's CDR changes and
	  loses the proper start time.

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: (closes issue #13197) Reported by: pj (closes
	  issue #13051) Reported by: pj This patch substitutes commas in
	  the expr supplied to the if () statement, as in if ( expr ) ...
	  This solves both the bugs above, and makes the source symmetric
	  with switch statements, which were earlier reported to need this
	  sort of treatment. I tested this using the examples, both for the
	  compiler and at run time. Looks good.

	* configure, configure.ac: Qwell pointed out, via IRC, that the
	  previous fix only worked when explicitly set. When nothing is

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Merging the imap_consistency branch. The
	  main aim of this branch was to make the IMAP code function in the
	  same manner as the ODBC code does, eliminating the need for so
	  many IMAP-specific code chunks. The focal point of all of this
	  work was to make the various macros (e.g. RETRIEVE, DISPOSE)
	  functionally equivalent. While doing the above work, I also fixed
	  a few bugs that I came across in my testing. Among these were 1.
	  Fixed message forwarding. This was completely broken when using
	  IMAP. 2. Fixed the inability to save new messages as old and vice
	  versa. 3. Fixed the "delete" options in voicemail.conf when using
	  IMAP storage. Even though a few bugs were fixed and the code is a
	  lot more consistent, the one thing that was *not* improved in
	  this branch was performance. The merge of this to trunk may not
	  come immediately due to the amount of work it will probably
	  involve. (closes issue #12764) Reported by: balsamcn

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, include/asterisk/options.h, main/asterisk.c,
	  channels/chan_dahdi.c: As suggested by seanbright, the
	  PSEUDO_CHAN_LEN in app_chanspy should be set at load time, not at
	  compile time, since dahdi_chan_name is determined at load time.
	  Also changed the next_unique_id_to_use to have the static
	  qualifier. Also added the dahdi_chan_name_len variable so that
	  strlen(dahdi_chan_name) isn't necessary. Thanks to seanbright for
	  the suggestion.

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: Zap/pseudo is ten characters, but
	  DAHDI/pseudo is twelve. The strncmp call in next_channel should
	  account for this.

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: Update the "last" channel in next_channel in
	  app_chanspy so that the same pseudo channel isn't constantly
	  returned. related to issue #13124

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c: Small cleanup. Move the declaration of the
	  DAHDI_SPANINFO variable to the block where it is used. This
	  allows one less #ifdef HAVE_PRI to clutter things up. Thanks to
	  Tzafrir for pointing this out on #asterisk-dev

	* include/asterisk/stringfields.h, main/utils.c: minor optimization
	  for stringfields: when a field is being set to a larger value
	  than it currently contains and it happens to be the most recent
	  field allocated from the currentl pool, it is possible to 'grow'

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: another Fix because of r119585, this
	  commit has broken high frequented BRI Ports, there was a

	  reused later, the corresponding port could got stuck then. So it
	  is recommended to upgrade for chan_misdn users.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Allow Spiraled INVITEs to work correctly
	  within Asterisk. Prior to this change, a spiraled INVITE would
	  cause a 482 Loop Detected to be sent to the caller. With this
	  change, if a potential loop is detected, the Request-URI is
	  inspected to see if it has changed from what was originally
	  received. If pedantic mode is on, then this inspection is fully
	  RFC 3261 compliant. If pedantic mode is not on, then a string
	  comparison is used to test the equality of the two R-URIs. This
	  has been tested by using OpenSER to rewrite the R-URI and send
	  the INVITE back to Asterisk. (closes issue #7403) Reported by:

	  This is frequently misunderstood as a failure of Asterisk, not a
	  failure of the network to reach the other party. This document
	  tries to assist the Asterisk user in sorting out these issues by
	  explaining the logic and pointing at some possible causes.
	  Hopefully, we will get other questions now :-)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Move the init_queue call back to where it used
	  to be (changed Sept 12 last year). It was moved then to prevent a
	  memory leak. Since then, the same memory leak recurred and was
	  fixed in a better way. Now it has been found that the placement
	  of this init_queue call can cause problems if a realtime queue
	  has values changed to an empty string. The problem is that the
	  default value for that queue parameter would not be set. (closes
	  issue #13084) Reported by: elbriga

	* apps/app_queue.c: Apparently, "thread safety" is important,
	  whatever that means. :P (Thanks Russell!)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Make absolutely certain that the transfer
	  datastore is removed from the calling channel once the caller is
	  finished in the queue. This could have weird con- sequences when
	  dialing local queue members when multiple transfers occur on a
	  single call. Also fixed a memory leak that would occur when an
	  attended transfer occurred from a queue member. (closes issue

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: (closes issue #13090) Reported by: murf The
	  problem was that, esoteric as it is, because the hangerupper
	  context immediately preceded the std-priv-extent macro, that the
	  checking code accidentally would fall from traversing hangerupper
	  into the std-priv-exten macro, where it would hit the hangerupper
	  in the 'includes', and proceed into an infinite recursion. A
	  small fix to traverse into the statements of the context instead
	  of the context solves this issue. I also added some commented out
	  printfs for debug, which were pretty handy in the face of a dorky
	  gdb. This was a problem around since the package was first
	  written; but evidently pretty rare in turning up in the field.

	  entirely. I think it is not necessary to see this message. It
	  didn't state that a NoOp() was inserted automatically on your

	* main/cdr.c, apps/app_forkcdr.c: (closes issue #10668) (closes
	  issue #11721) (closes issue #12726) Reported by: arkadia Tested
	  by: murf These changes: 1. revert the changes made via bug 10668;
	  I should have known that such changes, even tho they made sense
	  at the time, seemed like an omission, etc, were actually integral
	  to the CDR system via forkCDR. It makes sense to me now that
	  forkCDR didn't natively end any CDR's, but rather depended on
	  natively closing them all at hangup time via traversing and
	  closing them all, whether locked or not. I still don't completely
	  understand the benefits of setvar and answer operating on locked
	  cdrs, but I've seen enough to revert those changes also, and stop
	  messing up users who depended on that behavior. bug 12726 found
	  reverting the changes fixed his changes, and after a long review
	  and working on forkCDR, I can see why. 2. Apply the suggested
	  enhancements proposed in 10668, but in a completely compatible
	  way. ForkCDR will behave exactly as before, but now has new
	  options that will allow some actions to be taken that will
	  slightly modify the outcome and side-effects of forkCDR. Based on
	  conversations I've had with various people, these small tweaks
	  will allow some users to get the behavior they need. For
	  instance, users executing forkCDR in an AGI script will find the
	  answer time set, and DISPOSITION set, a situation not covered
	  when the routines were first written. 3. A small problem in the
	  cdr serializer would output answer and end times even when they
	  were not set. This is now fixed.

	* main/channel.c, include/asterisk/lock.h: A change to the way
	  channel locks are handled when DEBUG_CHANNEL_LOCKS is defined.
	  After debugging a deadlock, it was noticed that when
	  DEBUG_CHANNEL_LOCKS is enabled in menuselect, the actual origin
	  of channel locks is obscured by the fact that all channel locks
	  appear to happen in the function ast_channel_lock(). This code
	  change redefines ast_channel_lock to be a macro which maps to
	  __ast_channel_lock(), which then relays the proper file name,
	  line number, and function name information to the core lock
	  functions so that this information will be displayed in the case
	  that there is some sort of locking error or core show locks is
	  issued.

2008-05-13 21:17 +0000 [r115990-116038]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_local.c: Fix a deadlock involving channel
	  autoservice and chan_local that was debugged and fixed by
	  mmichelson and me. We observed a system that had a bunch of
	  threads stuck in ast_autoservice_stop(). The reason these threads
	  were waiting around is because this function waits to ensure that
	  the channel list in the autoservice thread gets rebuilt before
	  the stop() function returns. However, the autoservice thread was
	  also locked, so the autoservice channel list was never getting
	  rebuilt. The autoservice thread was stuck waiting for the channel
	  lock on a local channel. However, the local channel was locked by
	  a thread that was stuck in the autoservice stop function. It
	  turned out that the issue came down to the local_queue_frame()
	  function in chan_local. This function assumed that one of the
	  channels passed in as an argument was locked when called.
	  However, that was not always the case. There were multiple cases
	  in which this channel was not locked when the function was
	  called. We fixed up chan_local to indicate to this function
	  whether this channel was locked or not. The previous assumption
	  had caused local_queue_frame() to improperly return with the
	  channel locked, where it would then never get unlocked. (closes
	  issue #12584) (related to issue #12603)

	* main/autoservice.c: Fix an issue that I noticed in autoservice
	  while mmichelson and I were debugging a different problem. I
	  noticed that it was theoretically possible for two threads to
	  attempt to start the autoservice thread at the same time. This
	  change makes the process of starting the autoservice thread,
	  thread-safe.

	  ........ r115564 | russell | 2008-05-08 14:14:04 -0500 (Thu, 08
	  May 2008) | 25 lines Fix a race condition that bbryant just found
	  while doing some IAX2 testing. He was running Asterisk trunk
	  running IAX2 calls through a few Asterisk boxes, however, the
	  audio was extremely choppy. We looked at a packet trace and saw a
	  storm of INVAL and VNAK frames being sent from one box to
	  another. It turned out that what had happened was that one box
	  tried to send a CONTROL frame before the 3 way handshake had
	  completed. So, that frame did not include the destination call
	  number, because it didn't have it yet. Part of our recent work
	  for security issues included an additional check to ensure that
	  frames that are supposed to include the destination call number
	  have the correct one. This caused the frame to be rejected with
	  an INVAL. The frame would get retransmitted for forever, rejected
	  every time ... This race condition exists in all versions that
	  got the security changes, in theory. However, it is really only
	  likely that this would cause a problem in Asterisk trunk. There
	  was a control frame being sent (SRCUPDATE) at the _very_
	  beginning of the call, which does not exist in 1.2 or 1.4.
	  However, I am fixing all versions that could potentially be
	  affected by the introduced race condition. These changes are what
	  bbryant and I came up with to fix the issue. Instead of simply
	  dropping control frames that get sent before the handshake is
	  complete, the code attempts to wait a little while, since in most
	  cases, the handshake will complete very quickly. If it doesn't
	  complete after yielding for a little while, then the frame gets
	  dropped. ........

	* include/asterisk/dlinkedlists.h (added), channels/chan_iax2.c:
	  Merge changes from team/russell/iax2_find_callno and
	  iax2_find_callno_1.4 These changes address a critical performance
	  issue introduced in the latest release. The fix for the latest
	  security issue included a change that made Asterisk randomly
	  choose call numbers to make them more difficult to guess by
	  attackers. However, due to some inefficient (this is by far, an
	  understatement) code, when Asterisk chose high call numbers,
	  chan_iax2 became unusable after just a small number of calls. On
	  a small embedded platform, it would not be able to handle a
	  single call. On my Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.33 GHz, I couldn't run
	  more than about 16 IAX2 channels. Ouch. These changes address
	  some performance issues of the find_callno() function that have
	  bothered me for a very long time. On every incoming media frame,
	  it iterated through every possible call number trying to find a
	  matching active call. This involved a mutex lock and unlock for
	  each call number checked. So, if the random call number chosen
	  was 20000, then every media frame would cause 20000 locks and
	  unlocks. Previously, this problem was not as obvious since
	  Asterisk always chose the lowest call number it could. A second
	  container for IAX2 pvt structs has been added. It is an astobj2
	  hash table. When we know the remote side's call number, the pvt
	  goes into the hash table with a hash value of the remote side's
	  call number. Then, lookups for incoming media frames are a very
	  fast hash lookup instead of an absolutely insane array traversal.
	  In a quick test, I was able to get more than 3600% more IAX2
	  channels on my machine with these changes.

	  of queues.conf. Additionally, don't try to (re)set options when

	* channels/chan_h323.c: The call_token on the pvt can occasionally
	  be NULL, causing a crash. If it is NULL, we can skip this
	  channel, since it can't the one we're looking for. (closes issue

	* main/channel.c: Increase the retry count when attempting to show
	  channels. This apparently cleared an issue someone was seeing
	  when attempting to show channels when the load was high. (closes

	  by russell (license 2) Tested by: falves11

	* apps/app_dial.c, apps/app_queue.c: If the datastore has been
	  moved to another channel due to a masquerade, then freeing the
	  datastore here causes an eventual double free when the new
	  channel hangs up. We should only free the datastore if we were
	  able to successfully remove it from the channel we are
	  referencing (i.e. the datastore was not moved). (closes issue
	  #12359) Reported by: pguido

	* main/channel.c: Save a local copy of the generate callback prior
	  to unlocking the channel in case the generate callback goes NULL
	  on us after the channel is unlocked. Thanks to Russell for
	  pointing this need out to me.

2008-04-11 22:32 +0000 [r114083]  Terry Wilson <twilson@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Several places in the code called
	  find_callno() (which releases the lock on the pvt structure) and
	  then immediately locked the call and did things with it.
	  Unfortunately, the call can disappear between the find_callno and
	  the lock, causing Bad Stuff(tm) to happen. Added
	  find_callno_locked() function to return the callno withtout
	  unlocking for instances that it is needed. (issue #12400)

	* apps/app_playback.c, main/pbx.c: These small documentation
	  updates made in response to a query in asterisk-users, where a
	  user was using Playback, but needed the features of Background,
	  and had no idea that Background existed, or that it might provide
	  the features he needed. I thought the best way to avert these
	  kinds of queries was to provide "See Also" references in all
	  three of "Background", "Playback", "WaitExten". Perhaps a project
	  to do this with all related apps is in order.

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c, include/asterisk/ael_structs.h: (closes issue
	  #12302) Reported by: pj Tested by: murf These changes will set a
	  channel variable ~~EXTEN~~ just before generating code for a
	  switch, with the value of ${EXTEN}. The exten is marked as having
	  a switch, and ever after that, till the end of the exten, we
	  substitute any ${EXTEN} with ${~~EXTEN~~} instead in application
	  arguments; (and the ${EXTEN: also). The reason for this, is that
	  because switches are coded using separate extensions to provide
	  pattern matching, and jumping to/from these switch extensions
	  messes up the ${EXTEN} value, which blows the minds of users.

	  reason is that that revision was not for an actual bug fix per
	  se, and so it really should not have been in 1.4 in the first
	  place. Plus, people who compile with DO_CRASH are more likely to
	  encounter a crash due to this change. While I think the usage of
	  DO_CRASH in ast_sched_del is a bit absurd, this sort of change is
	  beyond the scope of 1.4 and should be done instead in a developer
	  branch based on trunk so that all scheduler functions are fixed
	  at once. I also am reverting the change to trunk and 1.6 since
	  they also suffer from the DO_CRASH potential. (closes issue

	  thread to wrap back around to the beginning of its loop. (closes

	* main/config.c: (closes issue #11442) Reported by: tzafrir
	  Patches: 11442.patch uploaded by murf (license 17) Tested by:
	  murf I didn't give tzafrir very much time to test this, but if he
	  does still have remaining issues, he is welcome to re-open this
	  bug, and we'll do what is called for. I reproduced the problem,
	  and tested the fix, so I hope I am not jumping by just going
	  ahead and committing the fix. The problem was with what file_save
	  does with templates; firstly, it tended to print out multiple
	  options: [my_category](!)(templateref) instead of
	  [my_category](!,templateref) which is fixed by this patch.
	  Nextly, the code to suppress output of duplicate declarations
	  that would occur because the reader copies inherited declarations
	  down the hierarchy, was not working. Thus: [master-template](!)
	  mastervar = bar [template](!,master-template) tvar = value
	  [cat](template) catvar = val would be rewritten as: ;! ;!
	  Automatically generated configuration file ;! Filename:
	  experiment.conf (/etc/asterisk/experiment.conf) ;! Generator:
	  Manager ;! Creation Date: Tue Mar 18 23:17:46 2008 ;!
	  [master-template](!) mastervar = bar
	  [template](!,master-template) mastervar = bar tvar = value
	  [cat](template) mastervar = bar tvar = value catvar = val This
	  has been fixed. Since the config reader 'explodes' inherited vars
	  into the category, users may, in certain circumstances, see
	  output different from what they originally entered, but it should
	  be both correct and equivalent.

	* main/utils.c: Fix a logic flaw in the code that stores lock info
	  which is displayed via the "core show locks" command. The idea
	  behind this section of code was to remove the previous lock from
	  the list if it was a trylock that had failed. Unfortunately,
	  instead of checking the status of the previous lock, we were
	  referencing the index immediately following the previous lock in
	  the lock_info->locks array. The result of this problem, under the
	  right circumstances, was that the lock which we currently in the
	  process of attempting to acquire could "overwrite" the previous
	  lock which was acquired. While this does not in any way affect
	  typical operation, it *could* lead to misleading "core show
	  locks" output.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a race condition in the SIP packet
	  scheduler which could cause a crash. chan_sip uses the scheduler
	  API in order to schedule retransmission of reliable packets (such
	  as INVITES). If a retransmission of a packet is occurring, then
	  the packet is removed from the scheduler and retrans_pkt is
	  called. Meanwhile, if a response is received from the packet as
	  previously transmitted, then when we ACK the response, we will
	  remove the packet from the scheduler and free the packet. The
	  problem is that both the ACK function and retrans_pkt attempt to
	  acquire the same lock at the beginning of the function call. This
	  means that if the ACK function acquires the lock first, then it
	  will free the packet which retrans_pkt is about to read from and
	  write to. The result is a crash. The solution: 1. If the ACK
	  function fails to remove the packet from the scheduler and the
	  retransmit id of the packet is not -1 (meaning that we have not
	  reached the maximum number of retransmissions) then release the
	  lock and yield so that retrans_pkt may acquire the lock and
	  operate. 2. Make absolutely certain that the ACK function does
	  not recursively lock the lock in question. If it does, then
	  releasing the lock will do no good, since retrans_pkt will still
	  be unable to acquire the lock. (closes issue #12098) Reported by:

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, main/channel.c, include/asterisk/channel.h:
	  Fix another issue that was causing crashes in chanspy. This
	  introduces a new datastore callback, called chan_fixup(). The
	  concept is exactly like the fixup callback that is used in the
	  channel technology interface. This callback gets called when the
	  owning channel changes due to a masquerade. Before this was
	  introduced, if a masquerade happened on a channel being spyed on,

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Change AST_SCHED_DEL use to ast_sched_del
	  for autocongestion in chan_sip. The scheduler callback will
	  always return 0. This means that this id is never rescheduled, so
	  it makes no sense to loop trying to delete the id from the
	  scheduler queue. If we fail to remove the item from the queue
	  once, it will fail every single time. (Yes I realize that in this
	  case, the macro would exit early because the id is set to -1 in
	  the callback, but it still makes no sense to use that macro in
	  favor of calling ast_sched_del once and being done with it) This
	  is the first of potentially several such fixes.

	* include/asterisk/sched.h: Added a large comment before the
	  AST_SCHED_DEL macro to explain its purpose as well as when it is
	  appropriate and when it is not appropriate to use it. I also
	  removed the part of the debug message that mentions that this is
	  probably a bug because there are some perfectly legitimate places
	  where ast_sched_del may fail to delete an entry (e.g. when the
	  scheduler callback manually reschedules with a new id instead of
	  returning non-zero to tell the scheduler to reschedule with the
	  same idea). I also raised the debug level of the debug message in
	  AST_SCHED_DEL since it seems like it could come up quite
	  frequently since the macro is probably being used in several
	  places where it shouldn't be. Also removed the redundant line,
	  file, and function information since that is provided by ast_log.

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, main/channel.c: (closes issue #12187,
	  reported by atis, fixed by me after some brainstorming on the
	  issue with mmichelson) - Update copyright info on app_chanspy. -
	  Fix a race condition that caused app_chanspy to crash. The issue
	  was that the chanspy datastore magic that was used to ensure that
	  spyee channels did not disappear out from under the code did not
	  completely solve the problem. It was actually possible for
	  chanspy to acquire a channel reference out of its datastore to a
	  channel that was in the middle of being destroyed. That was
	  because datastore destruction in ast_channel_free() was done near
	  the end. So, this left the code in app_chanspy accessing a
	  channel that was partially, or completely invalid because it was
	  in the process of being free'd by another thread. The following
	  sort of shows the code path where the race occurred:
	  =============================================================================
	  Thread 1 (PBX thread for spyee chan) || Thread 2 (chanspy)
	  --------------------------------------||-------------------------------------

	* main/udptl.c, utils/Makefile, main/Makefile,

	  static function called 'input' that is not used, so for the
	  moment we'll stop having the compiler tell us about unused
	  variables in the flex source files (a better fix would be to
	  improve our flex post-processing to remove the unused function) -
	  main/stdtime/localtime.c makes assumptions about signed integer
	  overflow, and gcc-4.3's improved optimizer tries to take
	  advantage of handling potential overflow conditions at compile
	  time; for now, suppress these optimizations until we can fiure
	  out if the code needs improvement - main/udptl.c has some
	  references to uninitialized variables; in one case there was no
	  bug, but in the other it was certainly possibly for unexpected
	  behavior to occur - main/editline/readline.c had an unused
	  variable

	* main/pbx.c: Fix another bug specifically related to asynchronous
	  call origination. Once the PBX is started on the channel using
	  ast_pbx_start(), then the ownership of the channel has been
	  passed on to another thread. We can no longer access it in this
	  code. If the channel gets hung up very quickly, it is possible
	  that we could access a channel that has been free'd. (inspired by
	  BE-386)

	* main/pbx.c: Fix some bugs related to originating calls. If the
	  code failed to start a PBX on the channel (such as if you set a
	  call limit based on the system's load average), then there were
	  cases where a channel that has already been free'd using
	  ast_hangup() got accessed. This caused weird memory corruption
	  and crashes to occur. (fixes issue BE-386) (much debugging credit

	* main/asterisk.c, main/channel.c, include/asterisk.h,
	  main/autoservice.c: Merge in some changes from
	  team/russell/autoservice-nochans-1.4 These changes fix up some
	  dubious code that I came across while auditing what happens in
	  the autoservice thread when there are no channels currently in
	  autoservice. 1) Change it so that autoservice thread doesn't keep
	  looping around calling ast_waitfor_n() on 0 channels twice a
	  second. Instead, use a thread condition so that the thread
	  properly goes to sleep and does not wake up until a channel is
	  put into autoservice. This actually fixes an interesting bug, as
	  well. If the autoservice thread is already running (almost always
	  is the case), then when the thread goes from having 0 channels to
	  have 1 channel to autoservice, that channel would have to wait
	  for up to 1/2 of a second to have the first frame read from it.
	  2) Fix up the code in ast_waitfor_nandfds() for when it gets
	  called with no channels and no fds to poll() on, such as was the
	  case with the previous code for the autoservice thread. In this
	  case, the code would call alloca(0), and pass the result as the
	  first argument to poll(). In this case, the 2nd argument to
	  poll() specified that there were no fds, so this invalid pointer
	  shouldn't actually get dereferenced, but, this code makes it
	  explicit and ensures the pointers are NULL unless we have valid
	  data to put there. (related to issue #12116)

	* main/autoservice.c: Fix a major bug in autoservice. There was a
	  race condition in the handling of the list of channels in
	  autoservice. The problem was that it was possible for a channel
	  to get removed from autoservice and destroyed, while the
	  autoservice thread was still messing with the channel. This led
	  to memory corruption, and caused crashes. This explains multiple
	  backtraces I have seen that have references to autoservice, but

	  channels/chan_zap.c, res/res_smdi.c, configs/smdi.conf.sample:
	  Merge changes from team/russell/smdi-1.4 This commit brings in a
	  significant set of changes to the SMDI support in Asterisk. There
	  were a number of bugs in the current implementation, most notably
	  being that it was very likely on busy systems to pop off the
	  wrong message from the SMDI message queue. So, this set of
	  changes fixes the issues discovered as well as introducing some
	  new ways to use the SMDI support which are required to avoid the
	  bugs with grabbing the wrong message off of the queue. This code
	  introduces a new interface to SMDI, with two dialplan functions.
	  First, you get an SMDI message in the dialplan using
	  SMDI_MSG_RETRIEVE() and then you access details in the message
	  using the SMDI_MSG() function. A side benefit of this is that it
	  now supports more than just chan_zap. For example, with this
	  implementation, you can have some FXO lines being terminated on a
	  SIP gateway, but the SMDI link in Asterisk. Another issue with
	  the current implementation is that it is quite common that the
	  station ID that comes in on the SMDI link is not necessarily the
	  same as the Asterisk voicemail box. There are now additional
	  directives in the smdi.conf configuration file which let you map
	  SMDI station IDs to Asterisk voicemail boxes. Yet another issue
	  with the current SMDI support was related to MWI reporting over
	  the SMDI link. The current code could only report a MWI change
	  when the change was made by someone calling into voicemail. If
	  the change was made by some other entity (such as with IMAP
	  storage, or with a web interface of some kind), then the MWI
	  change would never be sent. The SMDI module can now poll for MWI
	  changes if configured to do so. This work was inspired by and
	  primarily done for the University of Pennsylvania. (also related
	  to issue #9260)

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: This patch fixes some pretty significant
	  problems with how app_chanspy handles pointers to channels that
	  are being spied upon. It was very likely that a crash would occur
	  if the channel being spied upon hung up. This was because the
	  current ast_channel handling _requires_ that the object is locked
	  or else it could disappear at any time (except in the owning
	  channel thread). So, this patch uses some channel datastore magic
	  on the spied upon channel to be able to detect if and when the
	  channel goes away. (closes issue #11877) (patch written by me,
	  but thanks to kpfleming for the idea, and to file for review)

	* main/utils.c: Improve the lock tracking code a bit so that a
	  bunch of old locks that threads failed to lock don't sit around
	  in the history. When a lock is first locked, this checks to see
	  if the last lock in the list was one that was failed to be
	  locked. If it is, then that was a lock that we're no longer
	  sitting in a trylock loop trying to lock, so just remove it.

	* main/config.c: Allow the use of #include and #exec in situations
	  where the max include depth was only 1. Specifically, this fixes
	  using #include and #exec in extconfig.conf. This was basically
	  caused because the config file itself raises the include level to
	  1. I opted not to raise the include limit, because recursion here
	  could cause very bizarre behavior. Pointed out, and tested by
	  jmls (closes issue #12064)

	* doc/imapstorage.txt, configure, configure.ac: Final round of

	  installation of the IMAP c-client. If that check fails, then
	  configure will fail.

	* configure, configure.ac: Fix a bit of wrong logic in the

	* doc/imapstorage.txt, configure, configure.ac: I apparently

	  Now, if a source directory is specified with the --with-imap

	  then configure will fail and will not check for a package
	  installation.

	* doc/imapstorage.txt: Make a small clarification in the

	* doc/imapstorage.txt: Update documentation regarding configuration

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac: Change to the
	  configure logic regarding IMAP. Prior to this commit, if you
	  wished to configure Asterisk with IMAP support, you would use the
	  --with-imap configure switch in one of the following two ways:
	  --with-imap=/some/directory would look in the directory specified
	  for a UW IMAP source installation --with-imap would assume that
	  you had imap-2004g installed in .. relative to the Asterisk
	  source With this set of changes the two above options still work
	  the same, but there are two new behaviors, too.
	  --with-imap=system will assume that you have -libc-client.so
	  where you store your shared objects and will attempt to find
	  c-client headers in your include path either in the imap or
	  c-client directory. If either of the two original methods of
	  specifying the imap option should fail, then the check for
	  --with-imap =system will be performed in addition. It is only
	  after this "system" check that failure can happen.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix build for non-IMAP builds

	* channels/chan_local.c: Fixing an issue wherein monitoring local
	  channels was not possible. During a channel masquerade, the
	  monitors on the two channels involved are swapped. In 99% of the
	  cases this results in the desired effect. However, if monitoring
	  a local channel, this caused the monitor which was on the local
	  channel to get moved onto a channel which is immediately hung up
	  after the masquerade has completed. By swapping the monitors
	  prior to the masquerade, we avoid the problem by tricking the
	  masquerade into placing the monitor back onto the channel where
	  we want it. During the investigation of the issue, the channel's
	  monitor was the only thing that was swapped in such a manner
	  which did not make sense to have done. All other variable
	  swapping made sense.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Change a buffer in check_auth() to be a
	  thread local dynamically allocated buffer, instead of a massive
	  buffer on the stack. This fixes a crash reported by Qwell due to
	  running out of stack space when building with LOW_MEMORY defined.
	  On a very related note, the usage of BUFSIZ in various places in
	  chan_sip is arbitrary and careless. BUFSIZ is a system specific
	  define. On my machine, it is 8192, but by definition (according
	  to google) could be as small as 256. So, this buffer in
	  check_auth was 16 kB. We don't even support SIP messages larger
	  than 4 kB! Further usage of this define should be avoided, unless
	  it is used in the proper context.

	* main/rtp.c, include/asterisk/translate.h, main/frame.c,
	  main/translate.c, main/abstract_jb.c, channels/chan_iax2.c,
	  codecs/codec_zap.c, include/asterisk/frame.h: Commit a fix for
	  some memory access errors pointed out by the valgrind2.txt output
	  on issue #11698. The issue here is that it is possible for an
	  instance of a translator to get destroyed while the frame
	  allocated as a part of the translator is still being processed.
	  Specifically, this is possible anywhere between a call to
	  ast_read() and ast_frame_free(), which is _a lot_ of places in
	  the code. The reason this happens is that the channel might get
	  masqueraded during this time. During a masquerade, existing
	  translation paths get destroyed. So, this patch fixes the issue
	  in an API and ABI compatible way. (This one is for you,
	  paravoid!) It changes an int in ast_frame to be used as flag
	  bits. The 1 bit is still used to indicate that the frame contains
	  timing information. Also, a second flag has been added to
	  indicate that the frame came from a translator. When a frame with
	  this flag gets released and has this flag, a function is called
	  in translate.c to let it know that this frame is doing being
	  processed. At this point, the flag gets cleared. Also, if the
	  translator was requested to be destroyed while its internal frame
	  still had this flag set, its destruction has been deffered until
	  it finds out that the frame is no longer being processed.
	  Admittedly, this feels like a hack. But, it does fix the issue,
	  and I was not able to think of a better solution ...

	  using __STDC_VERSION__, and that's not real good; so I added back
	  in a DIFFERENT sed script to fix that little mess. Tested

2008-01-02 17:51 +0000 [r95890]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: A change to improve the accuracy of queue
	  logging in the case where a member does not answer during the
	  specified timeout period. Prior to this change, there was a small
	  chance that the member name recorded in this case would be blank.
	  Also prior to this change, if using the ringall strategy, if no
	  one answered the call during the specified timeout, the member
	  name listed in the queue log would randomly be one of the members
	  that was rung. (closes issue #11498, reported and tested by
	  hloubser, patched by me)

2007-12-31 23:43 +0000 [r95577]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* main/pbx.c: Avoiding a potentially bad locking situation.
	  ast_merge_contexts_and_delete writelocks the conlock, then calls
	  ast_hint_extension, which attempts to readlock the same lock.
	  Recursion with read-write locks is dangerous, so the inner lock
	  needs to be removed. I did this by copying the "guts" of
	  ast_hint_extension into ast_merge_contexts_and_delete (sans the
	  extra lock). (this change is inspired by the locking problems
	  seen in issue #11080, but I have no idea if this is the
	  problematic area experienced by the reporters of that issue)

2007-12-28 00:16 +0000 [r95095]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: I found a bug while browsing the queue code and
	  managed to reproduce it in a small setup. If a queue uses the
	  ringall strategy, it was possible through unfortunate coincidence
	  for a single member at a given penalty level to make app_queue
	  think that all members at that penalty level were unavailable and
	  cause the members at the next penalty level to be rung. With this
	  patch, we will only move to the next penalty level if ALL the
	  members at a given penalty level are unreachable.

	  was already set before starting autoservice, remember it and
	  ensure that the channel has the same setting when autoservice

	* main/autoservice.c: When a channel is in autoservice, mark a flag
	  on the channel that says that we only care about the END of a
	  digit. That way, no magic digit emulation stuff will happen when
	  all we're doing is queueing up END frames.

	  (closes issue #11628, patched by me)

	* Makefile: List include/asterisk/version.h as a .PHONY target

	* main/channel.c: Race: we need to wait to queue a NewChannel event
	  until after the channel is inserted into the channel list. The

	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2007-December/031145.html,
	  rizzo brought up some issues related to the way that the metadata
	  required for menuselect and the rest of the build system is
	  extracted from the source files. Since I had a few hours to kill
	  on an airplane today, I decided to improve this situation... so
	  now the system caches the extracted metadata and uses it to build
	  the menuselect 'tree' as much as it can. The result of this is
	  that when a single source file is changed, only the metadata for
	  that file needs to be extracted again, and the rest is used from
	  the cache files. I also reduced the number of forked processes
	  required to do the metadata extraction; it was actually possible
	  to do most of what we needed in the Makefiles themselves without
	  using any shell scripts at all! On my laptop, these changes
	  resulted in an 80% decrease in the time required for the
	  'menuselect.makeopts' automatic check to occur after editing a
	  single source file. While doing this work I also cleaned up a few
	  minor things in the Makefiles, adding a check for 'awk' to the
	  configure script and changed all remaining places we use 'grep'
	  or 'awk' to use the ones found by the configure script, and
	  changed the 'prep_tarball' script to build the menuselect
	  metadata so that tarballs of Asterisk will include it and won't
	  require the user to wait while it is extracted after unpacking.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fixing autofill to be more accurate.
	  Specifically, if calls ahead of the current caller were ringing
	  members (but not yet bridged) there could be available members
	  and waiting callers who would not get matched up. The member
	  availability checker was correctly determining the number of
	  available members in this scenario, but the queue itself did not
	  parallelly reflect this status on the pending calls. This commit
	  corrects the issue. (closes issue #11459, reported by

	* main/rtp.c: Add G729A as another possible payload name for G729.
	  Some devices use this instead of G729, which is perfectly normal
	  since the payload number itself is defined and can't be used by
	  anything else so the name doesn't matter that much. (closes issue

	* apps/app_queue.c: If there are no members in a queue, then the
	  loop where the datastore for detecting duplicate dialed numbers
	  will be skipped, meaning the datastore isn't created. This means
	  that when we try to free it, there's a crash. This stops that
	  crash from occurring. (closes issue #11499, reported by slavon,

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Avoid reinvite race situations with two
	  Asterisks trying to reinvite each other in 1.4 and trunk. This
	  patch implements support for the 491 error code that Asterisk 1.4
	  generates on situations where we get an incoming INVITE and
	  already has one in progress. Thanks to mavetju for reporting and
	  to Raj Jain for an excellent explanation of the problem. Patch by
	  myself. Tested with 8 Asterisk servers connected to each other in
	  a training network. Closes issue #10481

	* codecs/codec_zap.c: even though Asterisk explicitly requests that
	  endpoints using G.729 do *not* use Annex B (silence detection and
	  comfort noise generation) some do anyway; the transcoder card
	  interface does not currently work properly with CNG frames, so
	  trim off the CNG before sending the data

2007-12-07 21:24 +0000 [r91777-91830]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/utils.c: Make the lock protecting each thread's list of
	  locks it currently holds recursive. I think that this will fix
	  the situation where some people have said that "core show locks"
	  locks up the CLI. (related to issue #11080)

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix another bug in the DEBUG_THREADS
	  code. The ast_mutex_init() function had the mutex attribute
	  object marked as static. This means that multiple threads
	  initializing locks at the same time could step on each other and
	  end up with improperly initialized locks. (found when tracking
	  down locking issues related to issue #11080)

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: I love fixing lock related errors in the
	  lock debugging code. That's about as ironic as it gets in
	  Asterisk programming land. Anyway, I spotted this bug while
	  trying to track down why systems are locking up and acting weird
	  in issue #11080. The mutex attribute object was marked as static
	  in this function when it should not have been.

	* apps/app_dial.c: * Add channel locking around datastore
	  operations that expect the channel to be locked. * Document why
	  we don't record Local channels in the dialed interfaces list. *
	  Remove the dialed variable as it isn't needed. * Restructure some
	  code for clarity and coding guidelines stuff

	* apps/app_queue.c: * Add channel locking around datastore
	  operations that expect the channel to be locked. * Document why
	  we don't record Local channels in the dialed interfaces list. *
	  Handle memory allocation failure. * Remove the dialed variable,
	  as it wasn't actually needed. * Tweak some formatting to conform
	  to coding guidelines.

	* main/autoservice.c: * Add a bit more of a verbose comment as to
	  why a hangup frame needs to be queued up if autoservice gets a
	  NULL return from ast_read(). * Make the process of queueing the
	  hangup frame more efficient by putting the frame where it is
	  going to end up and avoiding some locking and extra memory
	  allocations and freeing.

	* main/autoservice.c: Hangups that happen during autoservice were
	  not processed appropriately. This is because a hangup actually
	  causes a NULL frame to be received, not a hangup frame. Queueing
	  a hangup if we receive a NULL frame during autoservice corrects
	  this problem (closes issue #11467, reported by jmls, patched by
	  me)

	  we're done messing with the iterator.

	* apps/app_dial.c, apps/app_queue.c: Allow dialing local channels
	  from Queue() and Dial() again. There was a slight flaw in the
	  code to prevent call forwards from looping that caused this
	  problem. (related to issue #11486)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix in an issue in the call forwarding handling
	  code that was causing crashes on every call into a queue. I'm not
	  entirely sure about the logic in this part of the code, so I want
	  to look at it some more tomorrow. However, this makes it safe and
	  keeps it from crashing. (closes issue #11486, reported by adamg,

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Reverting extra stuff I didn't mean to
	  commit

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, apps/app_dial.c: The 'G' option for Dial()
	  did not properly handle the case where only a label was provided.
	  This was due to the fact that the answering channel did not have
	  an extension set, so ast_parseable_goto would fail. This fix
	  eliminates the call to ast_parseable_goto on the answering
	  channel since it is a wasteful call. The answering channel and
	  the calling channel are both directed to the same extension and
	  context, just different priorities, so we can just copy the
	  values from the calling channel to the answering channel and
	  increment the answering channel's priority. (closes issue #11382,

	* main/utils.c: When DEBUG_THREADS is enabled, we only have the
	  details about who is holding a lock that we are waiting on for a
	  mutex, not rwlocks. This should fix the problem where people have
	  reported "core show locks" crashing sometimes.

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix some crashes in chan_iax2 that were
	  reported as happening on Mac systems. It turns out that the
	  problem was the Mac version of the ast_atomic_fetchadd_int()
	  function. The Mac atomic add function returns the _new_ value,
	  while this function is supposed to return the old value. So, the
	  crashes happened on unreferencing objects. If the reference count
	  was decreased to 1, ao2_ref() thought that it had been decreased
	  to zero, and called the destructor. However, there was still an
	  outstanding reference around. (closes issue #11176) (closes issue
	  #11289)

	* include/asterisk/file.h, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  include/asterisk/compiler.h: Modify file.h to maintain API
	  compatibility with earlier versions. If a recent compiler is
	  being used, then a warning will show up for any modules still
	  using the old name "private" instead of "_private". (patch
	  suggested by paravoid)

	* main/pbx.c: Make some changes to some additions I made recently
	  for doing channel autoservice when looking up extensions. This
	  code was added to handle the case where a dialplan switch was in
	  use that could block for a long time. However, the way that I
	  added it, it did this for all extension lookups. However, lookups
	  in the in-memory tree of extensions should _not_ take long enough
	  to matter. So, move the autoservice stuff to be only around
	  executing a switch.

	* apps/app_dial.c, main/channel.c, main/global_datastores.c
	  (added), channels/chan_local.c, main/Makefile,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h, include/asterisk/global_datastores.h
	  (added), apps/app_queue.c: A big one... This is the merge of the
	  forward-loop branch. The main change here is that call-forwards
	  can no longer loop. This is accomplished by creating a datastore
	  on the calling channel which has a linked list of all devices
	  dialed. If a forward happens, then the local channel which is
	  created inherits the datastore. If, through this progression of
	  forwards and datastore inheritance, a device is attempted to be
	  dialed a second time, it will simply be skipped and a warning
	  message will be printed to the CLI. After the dialing has been
	  completed, the datastore is detached from the channel and
	  destroyed. This change also introduces some side effects to the
	  code which I shall enumerate here: 1. Datastore inheritance has
	  been backported from trunk into 1.4 2. A large chunk of code has
	  been removed from app_dial. This chunk is the section of code
	  which handles the call forward case after the channel has been
	  requested but before it has been called. This was removed because
	  call-forwarding still works fine without it, it makes the code
	  less error-prone should it need changing, and it made this set of
	  changes much less painful to just have the forwarding handled in
	  one place in each module. 3. Two new files, global_datastores.h
	  and .c have been added. These are necessary since the datastore
	  which is attached to the channel may be created and attached in
	  either app_dial or app_queue, so they need a common place to find
	  the datastore info. This approach was taken in case similar
	  datastores are needed in the future, there will be a common place
	  to add them.

	  longer possible for a pointer to be invalid after ao2_link()
	  returns.

	* main/pbx.c: Removing some seemingly pointless code. This sets a
	  channel variable for every priority executed in the dialplan if
	  you have debug set to anything non-zero. This seems pointless due
	  to the fact that these channel variables are not referenced
	  anywhere else in the code and their names are esoteric enough
	  that they would not be practical to reference in the dialplan.
	  Plus the fact that this behavior isn't documented anywhere means
	  that the change is not likely to cause any disruption. If
	  anything, this may actually cause a slight performance increase
	  if running with debug on. The motivating influence for this code
	  change is the eventwhencalled option for queues. If set to vars,
	  all channel variables will be output to the manager. These
	  unnecessary channel variables make the output a lot more
	  difficult to deal with.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Recording greetings when using IMAP storage

	  used DUNDi for dialplan lookups. So, he theorized that if the
	  DUNDi lookups blocked for some period of time, that audio from
	  the zap channel could get lost. If the audio got lost, then it
	  wouldn't be run through the DTMF detector, and digits could get
	  lost. He was correct, and the following set of changes fixes the
	  problem. However, the changes go a little bit further than what
	  was necessary to fix this exact problem. 1) I updated
	  pbx_extension_helper() to autoservice the associated channel to
	  handle cases where extension lookups may take a long time. This
	  would normally be a dialplan switch that does some lookup over
	  the network, such as the DUNDi or IAX2 switches. This ensures
	  that even while a DUNDi lookup is blocking, the channel will be
	  continuously serviced. 2) I made a change to the autoservice
	  code. This is actually something that has bothered me for a long
	  time. When a channel is in autoservice, _all_ frames get thrown
	  away. However, some frames really shouldn't be thrown away. The
	  most notable examples are signalling (CONTROL) frames, and DTMF.
	  So, this patch queues up important frames while a channel is in
	  autoservice. When autoservice is stopped on the channel, the
	  queued up frames get stuck back on the channel so that they can
	  get processed instead of thrown away. 3) I made another change to
	  the autoservice code to handle the case where autoservice is
	  started on channels recursively. Previously, you could call
	  ast_autoservice_start() multiple times on a channel, and it would
	  stop the first time ast_autoservice_stop() gets called. Now, it
	  will ensure that autoservice doesn't actually stop until the
	  final call to ast_autoservice_stop().

	* apps/app_dial.c, main/cdr.c, configs/cdr.conf.sample,
	  include/asterisk/cdr.h: closes issue #11379; OK, this is an
	  attempt to make both sides happy. To the cdr.conf file, I added
	  the option 'unanswered', which defaults to 'no'. In this mode,
	  you will see a cdr for a call, whether it was answered or not.
	  The disposition will be NO ANSWER or ANSWERED, as appropriate.
	  The src is as you'd expect, the destination channel will be one
	  of the channels from the Dial() call, usually the last in the
	  list if more than one chan was specified. With unanswered set to
	  'yes', you will still see this cdr entry in both cases. But in
	  the case where the dial timed out, you will also see a cdr for
	  each line attempted, marked NO ANSWER, with no destination
	  channel name. The new option defaults to 'no', so you don't see
	  the pesky extra cdr's by default, and you will not see the
	  irritating 'not posted' messages.

	* res/res_odbc.c, configs/res_odbc.conf.sample,
	  include/asterisk/res_odbc.h, res/res_config_odbc.c: We previously
	  attempted to use the ESCAPE clause to set the escape delimiter to
	  a backslash. Unfortunately, this does not universally work on all
	  databases, since on databases which natively use the backslash as
	  a delimiter, the backslash itself needs to be delimited, but on
	  other databases that have no delimiter, backslashing the
	  backslash causes an error. So the only solution that I can come
	  up with is to create an option in res_odbc that explicitly
	  specifies whether or not backslash is a native delimiter. If it
	  is, we use it natively; if not, we use the ESCAPE clause to make
	  it one. Reported by: elguero Patch by: tilghman (Closes issue

	* main/loader.c, include/asterisk/module.h,
	  build_tools/make_buildopts_h: To help combat problems where
	  people build external modules (asterisk-addons or others) and
	  then change the build options of the Asterisk build in a way that
	  makes the incompatible without warning, this commit introduces an
	  MD5 signature of the important build-time options and includes
	  that signature into modules when they are built. When the loader
	  loads one of these modules and notices the problem, it will emit
	  a warning to console and refuse to initialize the module, as
	  doing so could cause the system to be unstable or even crash. If
	  you upgrade to this version of Asterisk, you must rebuild *all*
	  of your modules that came from other sources before trying to run
	  this version. If you are using Digium's G.729 binary codec
	  module, you will need v33 or newer.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, configs/misdn.conf.sample: if we're NT and

	  L1 for a very short while and restart it immediately. normally
	  T310 should be started and after 10 seconds or so the calls

	* main/pbx.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h: After seeing crashes related
	  to channel variables, I went looking around at the ways that
	  channel variables are handled. In general, they were not handled
	  in a thread-safe way. The channel _must_ be locked when reading
	  or writing from/to the channel variable list. What I have done to
	  improve this situation is to make pbx_builtin_setvar_helper() and
	  friends lock the channel when doing their thing. Asterisk API
	  calls almost all lock the channel for you as necessary, but this
	  family of functions did not. (closes issue #10923, reported by
	  atis) (closes issue #11159, reported by 850t)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: When traversing the list of channel
	  variables here in transmit_invite(), the asterisk channel must be
	  locked, as this data may change at any time. (I have seen
	  numerous reports of crashes related to the handling of channel
	  variables. There are a couple of issues on the bug tracker
	  related to it, but it has also been noted on IRC and mailing
	  lists. So, I am finding and fixing some places where channel
	  variables are handled improperly.)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix up some indentation.

	* main/srv.c, include/asterisk/srv.h: Merge changes from
	  asterisk/team/kpfleming/SRV-priority-handling Previously, the SRV
	  record support in Asterisk was broken. There was no guarantee on
	  what record Asterisk would choose to actually use. This set of
	  changes improves the situation by ensuring that Asterisk will
	  choose the highest priority record.

	* main/channel.c: Merge the last bit of changes from
	  asterisk/team/russell/readq-1.4 The issue here is that the
	  channel frame readq handling got broken when the code was
	  converted to use the linked list macros. It caused corruption of
	  the list head and tail pointers. So, I fixed up the usage of the
	  linked list macros and in passing, simplified the code. I also
	  documented what the code is doing, as it was a bit difficult to
	  figure out at first. This bug showed itself with crashes showing
	  messed up head/tail pointers for the readq. However, there are a
	  couple of crashes that aren't quite as obvious, but I think may
	  be related. So, if your bug gets closed by this commit, but you
	  still have a problem, please reopen or create a new bug report.

	  only work if there was only a single datastore on the old
	  channel.

	* pbx/pbx_config.c: closes issue #11108 -- where the 'dialplan
	  save' cli command saves a file where the semicolon is not
	  escaped. Fixed this; User also wanted comments to be preserved
	  across dialplan save, but this is impossible at this point in
	  time, because comments are not stored in the dialplan. They are
	  'compiled' out of extensions.conf. The only way to preserve those
	  comments is to use the config file reader/writer that the GUI
	  uses to allow online user edits. extensions.conf is first and
	  foremost, a config file, and is read in by the normal config-file
	  reading routines. Then, it is processed into a dialplan
	  (context/exten structs).

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: Included some verbage in the check_includes func,
	  to inform the user that included contexts that have no match in

	  or the in-memory contexts, as they may not be there at the time

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Merge the changes from

	  race condition related to the handling of POKEing peers.
	  Essentially, a reference to a peer is held by the scheduler when
	  there are pending callbacks, but the reference count didn't
	  reflect it. So, it was possible for a peer to hit a reference
	  count of zero and have its destructor begin to be called at the
	  same time that the scheduler thread ran a POKE related callback.
	  If that happened, a crash would likely occur. (closes issue

	  though, highlighted a problem with multiple contexts of the same
	  name. This should be OK, also. So, I added the extend keyword to
	  AEL, and it can preceed the 'context' keyword (mixed with
	  'abstract', if nec.). This will turn off the warnings in AEL if
	  the same context name is used 2 or more times. Also, I now call
	  ast_context_find_or_create for contexts now, instead of just
	  ast_context_create; I did this because pbx_config does this. The

	  make sense. There is no reason to have the base64 decode function
	  force a '\0' terminated buffer, when the result is almost always
	  binary, anyway. In fact, this caused some breakage, as some code
	  in res_crypto passed in a buffer exactly the right size to get

2007-10-17 21:39 +0000 [r86202]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Changing the strategy field of the call_queue
	  struct to be signed instead of unsigned, since the code attempts

	* apps/app_queue.c: Previously, app_queue created a thread to
	  handle every single device state change. I changed this a while
	  ago in trunk for performance reasons. However, bug 8407 points
	  out that it is actually a race condition, causing device state

	  send the output to ast_cli().

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make the default for the srvlookup option to
	  be yes. It doesn't really make sense for it to default to off.
	  The default configuration file has it on, and proper RFC

	* main/rtp.c: Update the remembered RTP peer information when

	  patch by me)

2007-10-05  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 1.4.12.1 released. (This is mainly to include the 
	  app_queue fix for a memory leak on reload, but includes a couple

	* apps/app_queue.c: Don't allocate space for queue members unless
	  it's needed. You end up deleting dynamic members on a reload. Not
	  good. closes issue (#10879, reported by dazza76, patched by me)

2007-10-04 21:36 +0000 [r84690]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: closes issue #10870 ; where a CUT() function call
	  in a switch expr doesn't execute correctly, because the commas in
	  the function args are not converted to vertbars before the func
	  is called. I modified just the switch code to convert the commas
	  to vertbars if there, but if more of these sort of probs are
	  found, I may have to resort to something a little more
	  fundamental. We'll see, I guess.

	  pbx/ael/ael-test/ref.ael-test3, pbx/pbx_ael.c,
	  pbx/ael/ael-test/ref.ael-test5: closes issue #10834 ; where a
	  null input to a switch statement results in a hangup; since
	  switch is implemented with extensions, and the default case is
	  implemented with a '.', and the '.' matches 1 or more remaining
	  characters, the case where 0 characters exist isn't matched, and
	  the extension isn't matched, and the goto fails, and a hangup
	  occurs. Now, when a default case is generated, it also generates
	  a single fixed extension that will match a null input. That
	  extension just does a goto to the default extension for that
	  switch. I played with an alternate solution, where I just tack an
	  extra char onto all the patterns and the goto, but not the
	  default case's pattern. Then even a null input will still have at
	  least one char in it. But it made me nervous, having that extra
	  char in , even if that's a pretty secret and low-level issue.

2007-10-02 14:12 +0000 [r84370]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Use snprintf instead of sprintf in one
	  place. There is no vulnerability here due to various buffer sizes
	  around the code, but I still didn't like seeing a non
	  length-limited copy of data coming off of the wire into a stack
	  buffer, as this would be a problem in the future if buffer sizes
	  elsewhere got changed or size limitations removed ...

2007-10-01 21:52 +0000 [r84291]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* Makefile, Makefile.rules, channels/Makefile: Add dist-clean
	  support for subdirs. Change h323 to only remove the Makefile on a
	  dist-clean, rather than a clean. This fixes a bug I found with
	  trying to run make after a make clean

2007-10-01 20:27 +0000 [r84239]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* pbx/ael/ael.tab.c, pbx/ael/ael.y, pbx/pbx_ael.c: closes issue

	  really don't care about EAGAIN unless we didn't read an entire
	  line. If there is a newline at the end if the read buffer, break,
	  because we got the whole thing. (reported and patched by bmd)

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Show rwlocks in the "core show locks"
	  output. Before, it only showed mutexes.

	* channels/Makefile: Remove another file in "make clean". (closes
	  issue #10814, paravoid)

	* apps/app_dial.c: Simplify the CAN_EARLY_BRIDGE macro a bit.

	* channels/chan_alsa.c: avoid the weird usage of assert() in the

2007-09-26 21:35 +0000 [r83910-83943]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: I changed my mind ... I think this should be
	  a LOG_NOTICE.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add a log message that was requested by the
	  masses in the developer tutorial session at Astricon. chan_sip
	  did not output any message when a call was rejected because the
	  extension was not found. This adds a verbose message (at verbose
	  level 3) to note when this happens.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: Fix building chan_misdn under dev-mode.
	  (please run the configure script with --enable-dev-mode so this
	  doesn't happen again ...)

2007-09-26 18:35 +0000 [r83879]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

2007-09-25 14:13 +0000 [r83637-83773]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* main/app.c: jmls pointed out that unsetting the group and setting
	  the group to the blank string aren't quite the same.

	* build_tools/make_defaults_h: In the source, keys are relative to
	  the datadir, not varlib (which is the same in most cases, but
	  it's good to be accurate). Closes issue #10811

	* doc/realtime.txt: Oops. Removed the unworkable workaround. This
	  note should never have been in the release.

	* main/app.c: Making change to group splitting, as discussed on the
	  -dev list. The main effect of this will be to permit
	  Set(GROUP([cat])=), i.e. unsetting a group.

2007-09-24 07:54 +0000 [r83620]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

2007-09-22 19:39 +0000 [r83558-83589]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: This closes issue #10788 -- The exact same fixes
	  are made here for the first arg in the for(arg1; arg2; arg3) {}
	  statement, as were done for the 3rd arg. It can now be an
	  assignment that will embedded in a Set() app, or a macro call, or
	  an app call.

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: This closes issue #10788 -- the 3rd arg in the for
	  statement is now wrapped in Set() only if there's an '=' in that
	  string. Otherwise, if it begins with '&', then a Macro call is
	  generated; otherwise it is made into an app call. A bit more
	  accomodating, keeps the new guys happy, and the guys with ael-1

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: When handling a reload of chan_iax2, don't
	  use an ao2_callback() to POKE all peers. Instead, use an
	  iterator. By using an iterator, the peers container is not locked
	  while the POKE is being done. It can cause a deadlock if the

	* main/manager.c: Fix a memory leak that can occur on systems under
	  higher load. The issue is that when events are appended to the
	  master event queue, they use the number of active sessions as a
	  use count so it will know when all active sessions at the time
	  the event happened have consumed it. However, the handling of the
	  number of sessions was not properly synchronized, so the use
	  count was not always correct, causing an event to disappear
	  early, or get stuck in the event queue for forever. (closes issue

2007-09-18 18:59 +0000 [r82834]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: there is no need for conditional logic to
	  select ->interface or ->membername, snince ->membername will
	  always be populated

2007-09-18 16:31 +0000 [r82802]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_dundi.c: When copying the contents from the wildcard
	  peer, do a deep copy instead of shallow copy so that it doesn't
	  crash when beging destroyed. (closes issue #10546, patch by me)

2007-09-18 15:28 +0000 [r82751]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* configs/sip.conf.sample: Correct the allowexternaldomains option
	  in SIP sample config. Issue 10753

2007-09-17 20:16 +0000 [r82594-82676]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, main/stdtime/localtime.c: Put a memset in
	  ast_localtime() instead of a couple places in app_voicemail to
	  prevent the problem everywhere instead of just a couple of
	  places. (related to issue #10746)

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Initialize some memory to fix crashes when
	  leaving voicemail. This problem was fixed by running Asterisk
	  under valgrind. (closes issue #10746, reported by arcivanov,
	  patched by me) *** IMPORTANT NOTE: We need to check to see if
	  this same bug exists elsewhere.

	* res/res_features.c: Handle the case where there are multiple
	  dynamic features with the same digit mapping, but won't always
	  match the activated on/by access controls. In that case, the code
	  needs to keep trying features for a match. (reported by Atis on
	  the asterisk-dev list, patched by me)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: revert a change that wasn't supposed to be
	  committed... doh!

	* apps/app_queue.c, channels/chan_iax2.c: fix a couple of places
	  where a logical member name (if specified) was not used, but
	  instead the direct interface was listed

2007-09-17 02:00 +0000 [r82514]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* main/pbx.c: (closes issue #10734) Reported by: asgaroth Instead
	  of passing a NULL pointer into snprintf pass "". It makes Solaris
	  much happier.

2007-09-14 21:19 +0000 [r82444]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/cdr.c: closes issue #10668; thanks to arkadia for his patch;
	  had to leave out the bit about ending the previous cdr in the
	  fork; it would destroy current implementations.

2007-09-14 21:17 +0000 [r82435]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* configs/zapata.conf.sample: Add a note to help clarify the value
	  set with the echocancel option. (inspired by Malcolm's blog post
	  on blogs.digium.com about HPEC)

2007-09-14 18:35 +0000 [r82396-82398]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Crap, I broke the build. Fixed.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Adding member name field to manager events

	  snar)

2007-09-14 17:48 +0000 [r82394]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: If a channel does not have an owner, do not
	  try to set a channel variable. This will end up making the
	  channel variable global, which is not right. Closes issue #10720,
	  patch by flefoll.

2007-09-14 15:50 +0000 [r82382-82385]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac, makeopts.in: Add
	  checking for libusb here, so nobody has to deal with conflicts in
	  the chan_usbradio-1.4 branch every time the configure script gets
	  changed

	* channels/chan_usbradio.c (removed), channels/xpmr (removed),
	  channels/Makefile: Remove chan_usbradio from the main 1.4 branch.
	  It can't live here because we have a strict policy to not include
	  new features in release branches. However, I'm going to merge it
	  into trunk, and I also have a special 1.4 based branch that
	  includes this module. svn co
	  http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/team/jdixon/chan_usbradio-1.4

2007-09-14 01:24 +0000 [r82368]  Jim Dixon <telesistant@hotmail.com>

	* apps/app_rpt.c: Fixed problem with changes made to cdr
	  functionality

2007-09-14 00:52 +0000 [r82367]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_usbradio.c: this new driver may not live in this
	  branch for long (since it is a new feature), but it definitely
	  should not be built by default

2007-09-14 00:34 +0000 [r82366]  Jim Dixon <telesistant@hotmail.com>

	* apps/app_rpt.c, channels/xpmr/xpmr_coef.h (added),

	  channels/xpmr (added), channels/xpmr/LICENSE (added),
	  channels/xpmr/sinetabx.h (added), configs/usbradio.conf.sample
	  (added), channels/Makefile, channels/xpmr/xpmr.c (added): Added

2007-09-13 23:11 +0000 [r82358]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_spool.c: Fix a small typo. retrytime > waittime

2007-09-13 20:16 +0000 [r82346]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Preemptively fixing a possible segfault. It is
	  possible that queuename is NULL (meaning pause ALL queues), so
	  use q->name instead.

2007-09-13 20:11 +0000 [r82344]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* cdr/cdr_csv.c: Fix a crash that could occur in cdr_csv when
	  mutliple threads tried to close the same file. Do we actually
	  need the locking here? What happens if you open the same file
	  twice, and two threads try to write to it at the same time? Is
	  fputs() going to write out the entire line at once? I suspect
	  that it could be possible for the second fopen to run during the
	  first fputs, so the position could be in the middle of the
	  previously written line... Issue 10347, initial patch by
	  explidous (but I removed all of the paranoia stuff..)

2007-09-13 18:57 +0000 [r82337-82339]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/astobj2.c: resolve a warning when not building under dev
	  mode

	* main/astobj2.c, main/asterisk.c, include/asterisk.h: Only compile
	  in tracking astobj2 statistics if dev-mode is enabled. Also, when
	  dev mode is enabled, register the CLI command that can be used to
	  run the astobj2 test and print out statistics.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Added logic to handle the unlikely case that
	  someone has two queues with the same name. Asterisk will log a
	  warning message letting the user know that one was already
	  defined with that name and is it skipping all further instances.
	  This also will work for realtime queues but in order for that to
	  happen, the user would have to trigger a perfectly timed reload
	  as a realtime queue is being looked up, which is highly unlikely
	  (but taken care of nonetheless).

2007-09-13 11:47 +0000 [r82309]  Philippe Sultan <philippe.sultan@gmail.com>

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c: Closes issue #9401, reported and patched
	  by irrot, with slight modifications by me. Handle DTMF sent by
	  Asterisk properly.

2007-09-12 21:56 +0000 [r82296]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_agi.c: Fix a check of the wrong pointer, as pointed out
	  by an XXX comment left in the code. The problem was harmless,
	  however.

2007-09-12 21:28 +0000 [r82291]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* main/stdtime/tzfile.h: Oops, wrong location for FreeBSD zone
	  files

2007-09-12 20:24 +0000 [r82286]  Dwayne M. Hubbard <dhubbard@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c: remove a race condition for the creation of
	  recordthread's, and fix a small memory leak. This closes issue#
	  10636

2007-09-12 20:12 +0000 [r82285]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* main/stdtime/private.h, main/stdtime/tzfile.h,
	  include/asterisk/localtime.h, main/stdtime/localtime.c: Working
	  on issue #10531 exposed a rather nasty 64-bit issue on
	  ast_mktime, so we updated the localtime.c file from source. Next
	  we'll have to write ast_strptime to match.

2007-09-12 15:16 +0000 [r82278-82280]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/asterisk.c: Clean up the output of "asterisk -h". This
	  tweaks the wording and wraps lines at 80 characters. (closes
	  issue #10699, seanbright)

	* res/res_agi.c: revert patch from issue #10553, as someone not
	  using fastagi reported that this broke their system.

2007-09-12 14:30 +0000 [r82274-82276]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Accidentally committed changes to
	  app_voicemail which do NOT need to be in the 1.4 branch yet.
	  reverting...

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, apps/app_queue.c: We should only initialize
	  a realtime queue when it is allocated, not every time we access
	  it. This prevents the members ao2_container from being
	  reallocated every time the queue is accessed. I also removed a
	  debug message I had accidentally left in on a previous commit.

2007-09-11 22:37 +0000 [r82267]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix incorrect uses of ao2_find(). Every one of
	  these calls was reading bogus memory ...

2007-09-11 21:41 +0000 [r82265]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* codecs/gsm/src/lpc.c, codecs/gsm/src/long_term.c: (closes issue
	  #10679) Reported by: andrew Build under dev mode when K6OPTS is
	  enabled.

2007-09-11 20:49 +0000 [r82263]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix another missing unref of member objects.
	  This one was pointed out by Marta. When building the outgoing
	  list in try_calling(), a member reference is stored in each
	  outgoing entry. However, when this list got destroyed, the
	  reference was not released.

2007-09-11 20:36 +0000 [r82261]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/cdr.c: this change should fix issue # 10659 -- what I worry
	  about is how many other bug reports it may generate. Hopefully,
	  we can please the/a majority. Hopefully. We shall see. Calls not
	  marked ANSWERED and with only one channel name will not be
	  posted. This should eliminate the double CDR's.

2007-09-11 16:05 +0000 [r82252]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: All instances of ao2_iterators which were just
	  named 'i' have been renamed to 'mem_iter' so that when refcounted
	  queues are merged into trunk, there will be little confusion
	  regarding iterator names, especially when a queue and member
	  iterator are used in the same function.

2007-09-11 16:03 +0000 [r82250]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_dundi.c: The sample dundi.conf claims support for a
	  wildcard peer entry - [*], but the code did not support it. This
	  patch makes it work. (closes issue #10546, patch by dds, with
	  some changes by me)

2007-09-11 16:01 +0000 [r82249]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

2007-09-11 14:34 +0000 [r82198-82240]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Add a couple more missing unrefs of queue
	  member objects

	* apps/app_queue.c: Add a missing unref of a queue member in an
	  error handling block

	* apps/app_queue.c: Document why membercount can not simply be
	  replaced by ao2_container_count()

	* main/astobj2.c: backport astobj2 race condition fix. This
	  function is the exact same as trunk so it applies here as well.

2007-09-10 18:02 +0000 [r82155]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Convert struct member to use refcounts (closes

2007-09-10 15:02 +0000 [r82091]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* configs/misdn.conf.sample: Removing non-existent options from
	  misdn configuration sample. (closes issue #10678, reported and
	  patched by IgorG)

2007-09-09 02:35 +0000 [r82028]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix inline compiles on really old
	  compilers (who uses gcc 2.7 anymore, really?)

2007-09-08 18:41 +0000 [r81952-81997]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/asterisk.c: Fix a small memory leak. ast_unregister_atexit()
	  did not free the entry it removed.

	* .cleancount: (closes issue #10672) Bump the cleancount so that a
	  "make clean" will be forced. This is needed because my fix in
	  revision 81599 made a change to a data structure in file.h, and
	  since file dependency tracking is only on with dev-mode enabled,
	  file format modules that don't get rebuilt may crash, as is the
	  case with this issue. This makes me wonder - how much faster does
	  the code build without the file dependency tracking enabled? If
	  it doesn't make much of a difference, then it may be worth just
	  keeping it on all of the time, or perhaps just not in release
	  tarballs, so that this type of issue is avoided.

2007-09-07 19:48 +0000 [r81923]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Allow the MEMBERINTERFACE variable to be used
	  as the mixmonitor filename. This moves the setting of the
	  MEMBERINTERFACE variable to before mixmonitor. Issue 10671, patch
	  by sim.

2007-09-07 15:25 +0000 [r81886]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* configs/queues.conf.sample: Moving the explanation for joinempty
	  to a more appropriate place

2007-09-06 22:28 +0000 [r81832]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: (closes issue #9724, closes issue #10374)
	  Reported by: kenw Patches: 9724.txt uploaded by russell (license
	  2) Tested by: kenw, russell Resolve a deadlock that occurs when
	  doing a SIP transfer to parking. I come across this type of
	  deadlock fairly often it seems. It is very important to mind the
	  boundary between the channel driver and the core in respect to
	  the channel lock and the channel-pvt lock. Channel drivers lock
	  to lock the pvt and then the channel once it calls into the core,
	  while the core will do it in the opposite order. The way this is
	  avoided is by having channel drivers either release their pvt
	  lock while calling into the core, or such as in this case,
	  unlocking the pvt just long enough to acquire the channel lock.

2007-09-06 22:05 +0000 [r81778-81826]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* Makefile: We added COPTS for ASTCFLAGS additions, but not LDOPTS
	  for ASTLDFLAGS. This adds LDOPTS

	* include/asterisk/astobj2.h: This should fix a build issue that

	  astobj2

2007-09-05 20:53 +0000 [r81599]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/file.h, main/say.c, res/res_features.c,
	  main/file.c, include/asterisk/channel.h: Fix an issue that can
	  occur when you do an attended transfer to parking. If you
	  complete the transfer before the announcement of the parking spot
	  finishes, then the channel being parked will hear the remainder
	  of the announcement. These changes make it so that will not
	  happen anymore. Basically, res_features sets a flag on the
	  channel is playing the announcement to so that the file streaming
	  core knows that it needs to watch out for a channel masquerade,
	  and if it occurs, to abort the announcement. (closes BE-182)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fixed broken behavior of a reload on realtime
	  queues. Prior to this patch, if a reload was issued and a
	  realtime queue had callers waiting in it, then the queue would be

	  (in fact, a debug message warning about a memory leak would come
	  up). With this patch, reloads do not touch realtime queues at
	  all.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/chan_misdn.c: Fixed a severe
	  issue where a misdn_read would lock the channel, but read would
	  not return because it blocks. later chan_misdn would try to queue
	  a frame like a AST_CONTROL_ANSWER which could result in a
	  deadlock situation. misdn_read will now not block forever
	  anymore, and we don't queue the ANSWER frame at all when we
	  already was called with misdn_answer -> answer would be called
	  twice. Also we don't explicitly send a RELEASE_COMPLETE on
	  receiption of a RELEASE anymore, because mISDN does that for us,
	  this resulted in a problem on some switches, which would block
	  our port after some calls for a short while.

	* apps/app_queue.c: This patch, in essence, will correctly pause a
	  realtime queue member and reflect those changes in the realtime
	  engine. (issue #10424, reported by irroot, patch by me) This
	  patch creates a new function called update_realtime_member_field,
	  which is a generic function which will allow any one field of a
	  realtime queue member to be updated. This patch only uses this
	  function to update the paused status of a queue member, but it
	  lays the foundation for persisting the state of a realtime member
	  the same way that static members' state is maintained when using
	  the persistentmembers setting

	* apps/app_queue.c: Changed some tabs to spaces

	  detecting whether realtime members were deleted. (closes issue
	  10541, reported by Alric, patched by me) The REALLY nice things
	  about this patch is that queue members now have a "realtime"
	  field which will be true if the member is a realtime member. This
	  means we can check this value prior to certain processing if it
	  should ONLY be done for realtime members.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Resolve a potential deadlock. In this case, a
	  single queue is locked, then the queue list. In changethread(),
	  the queue list is locked, and then each individual queue is
	  locked. Under the right circumstances, this could deadlock. As
	  such, I have unlocked the individual queue before locking the
	  queue list, and then locked the queue back after the queue list
	  is unlocked.

	* channels/chan_agent.c: DTMF begin frames should be ignored so
	  that when an agent acks a call with the '#' key, he doesn't cause

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix some issues with the handling of the
	  scheduler in chan_iax2. Most of the places that scheduled items
	  to be executed by the scheduler thread did not signal the
	  scheduler thread to wake up so that it could recalculate the time
	  until the next action. These changes will make the scheduler
	  thread more responsive and ensure that actions get executed as

	  and also does the debouncing on the trailing edge as well.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix some code where it was possible for a
	  reference to a peer to not get released when it should. Thank you
	  to Marta Carbone for pointing this out!

	* main/astobj2.c, include/asterisk/astobj2.h, channels/chan_iax2.c:
	  This is a hack to maintain old behavior of chan_iax2. This
	  ensures that if the peers and users are being stored in a linked
	  list, that they go in the list in the same order that the older
	  code used. This is necessary to maintain the behavior of which
	  peers and users get matched when traversing the container.

	* res/res_agi.c: Revert res_agi fix that didn't quite work until we
	  get it right ...

	* include/asterisk/astobj2.h: Add some more documentation on
	  iterating ao2 containers. The documentation implies that is
	  possible to miss an object or see an object twice while
	  iterating. After looking through the code and talking with
	  mmichelson, I have documented the exact conditions under which
	  this can happen (which are rare and harmless in most cases).

	* main/astobj2.c: When converting this code to use the list macros,
	  I changed it so objects are added to the head of a bucket instead
	  of the tail. However, while looking over code with mmichelson, we
	  noticed that the algorithm used in ao2_iterator_next requires
	  that items are added to the tail. This wouldn't have caused any
	  huge problem, but it wasn't correct. It meant that if an object
	  was added to a container while you were iterating it, and it was
	  added to the same bucket that the current element is in, then the
	  new object would be returned by ao2_iterator_next, and any other
	  objects in the bucket would be bypassed in the traversal.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't crash when using realtime in chan_sip
	  without an insecure setting in the database. (closes issue
	  #10348, reported by link55, fixed by me)

	* main/astobj2.c (added), main/Makefile, include/asterisk/astobj2.h
	  (added), doc/iax.txt, UPGRADE.txt, include/asterisk/strings.h,
	  channels/chan_iax2.c: Merge changes from
	  team/russell/iax_refcount. This set of changes fixes problems
	  with the handling of iax2_user and iax2_peer objects. It was very
	  possible for a thread to still hold a reference to one of these
	  objects while a reload operation tries to delete them. The fix
	  here is to ensure that all references to these objects are
	  tracked so that they can't go away while still in use. To
	  accomplish this, I used the astobj2 reference counted object
	  model. This code has been in one of Luigi Rizzo's branches for a
	  long time and was primarily developed by one of his students,
	  Marta Carbone. I wanted to go ahead and bring this in to 1.4
	  because there are other problems similar to the ones fixed by
	  these changes, so we might as well go ahead and use the new
	  astobj if we're going to go through all of the work necessary to
	  fix the problems. As a nice side benefit of these changes, peer
	  and user handling got more efficient. Using astobj2 lets us not
	  hold the container lock for peers or users nearly as long while
	  iterating. Also, by changing a define at the top of chan_iax2.c,
	  the objects will be distributed in a hash table, drastically
	  increasing lookup speed in these containers, which will have a
	  very big impact on systems that have a large number of users or
	  peers. The use of the hash table will be made the default in
	  trunk. It is not the default in 1.4 because it changes the
	  behavior slightly. Previously, since peers and users were stored
	  in memory in the same order they were specified in the
	  configuration file, you could influence peer and user matching
	  order based on the order they are specified in the configuration.
	  The hash table does not guarantee any order in the container, so
	  this behavior will be going away. It just means that you have to
	  be a little more careful ensuring that peers and users are
	  matched explicitly and not forcing chan_iax2 to have to guess
	  which user is the right one based on secret, host, and access
	  list settings, instead of simply using the username. If you have
	  any questions, feel free to ask on the asterisk-dev list.

	* res/res_agi.c: Juggie in #asterisk-dev was reporting problems
	  where fgets would return without reading the whole line when
	  using fastagi. When this happens, errno was set to EINTR or
	  EAGAIN. This patch accounts for the possibility and lets fgets
	  continue in that case.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't record SIP dialog history if it's not
	  turned on. Also, put an upper limit on how many history entires
	  will be stored for each SIP dialog. It is currently set to 50,
	  but can be increased if deemed necessary. (closes issue #10421,

	* include/asterisk/alaw.h, include/asterisk/ulaw.h: ugh. removing
	  the diffs from ulaw.h and alaw.h for now; accidentally added them
	  in 80166

	* main/alaw.c, include/asterisk/alaw.h, include/asterisk/ulaw.h:
	  This patch solves problem 1 in 8126; it should not slow down the
	  alaw codec, but should prevent signal degradation via multiple
	  trips thru the codec. Fossil estimates the twice thru this codec
	  will prevent fax from working. 4-6 times thru would result
	  hearable, noticeable, voice degradation.

	* apps/app_queue.c: After a discussion on #asterisk-dev, it was
	  decided that this should be in 1.4 as well. (issue #10424,
	  reported and patched by irroot)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Found a pointless ternary if. member->dynamic

2007-08-17 19:14 +0000 [r79906]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Patch allows for more seamless transition
	  from file storage voicemail to ODBC storage voicemail. If a
	  retrieval of a greeting from the database fails, but the file is
	  found on the file system, then we go ahead an insert the greeting
	  into the database. The result of this is that people who switch
	  from file storage to ODBC storage do not need to rerecord their
	  voicemail greetings.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, main/utils.c, include/asterisk/strings.h:
	  Don't send a semicolon over the wire in sip notify messages.
	  Caused by fix for issue 9938. I basically took the code that
	  existed before 9938 was fixed, and copied it into a new function
	  - ast_unescape_semicolon There should be very few places this

	  details)) Issue 10430, patch by me, with help/ideas from murf
	  (thanks murf).

	* channels/chan_local.c: Re-add the setting of callerid name and

2007-08-17 13:37 +0000 [r79857]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix some crashes in chan_sip. This patch
	  changes various places that add items to the scheduler to ensure
	  that they don't overwrite the ID of a previously scheduled item.
	  If there is one, it should be removed. (closes issue #10391,
	  closes issue #10256, probably others, patch by me)

2007-08-17 08:22 +0000 [r79833]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: sometimes we don't need to signal dtmf
	  tones to asterisk, we just want them to go through as inband.
	  Otherwise they might be generated by the other channel partner
	  and then there is a double tone.

2007-08-16 22:32 +0000 [r79756-79792]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: Fix a little race condition that could
	  cause a crash if two channels had MOH stopped at the same time
	  that were using a class that had been marked for deletion when
	  its use count hits zero.

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: This patch fixes a bug where reloading the
	  module with "module reload" did not delete classes from memory
	  that were no longer in the config. This patch fixes that problem
	  as well as another one. Previously, if you reloaded MOH using the
	  "moh reload" CLI command, which behaved differently than "module
	  reload ...", MOH had to be stopped on every channel and started
	  again immediately. However, there was no way to tell what class
	  was being used, so they would all fall back to the default class.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix more deadlocks in chan_iax2 that were
	  introduced by making frame handling and scheduling
	  multi-threaded. Unfortunately, we have to do some expensive
	  deadlock avoidance when queueing frames on to the ast_channel
	  owner of the IAX2 pvt struct. This was already handled for
	  regular frames, but ast_queue_hangup and ast_queue_control were
	  still used directly. Making these changes introduced even more
	  places where the IAX2 pvt struct can disappear in the context of
	  a function holding its lock due to calling a function that has to
	  unlock/lock it to avoid deadlocks. I went through and fixed all
	  of these places to account for this possibility. (issue #10362,
	  patch by me)

2007-08-16 21:16 +0000 [r79690-79748]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fixes a problem where agents would get
	  stuck busy due to their wrapuptime being longer than the queue's
	  wrapuptime and ringinuse=no for the queue. (closes issue #10215,
	  reported by Doug, repaired by me) Special thanks to fkasumovic
	  for pointing out the source of the problem and to bweschke for
	  helping to come up with a solution!

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: base_encode is not trying to open a log
	  file, so we should not call it a log file in the warning.
	  (related to issue #10452, reported by bcnit)

2007-08-16 09:37 +0000 [r79665]  Philippe Sultan <philippe.sultan@gmail.com>

	* res/res_jabber.c: A fix for two critical problems detected while
	  working with Daniel McKeehan in issue #10184. Upon priority
	  change, the resource list is not NULL terminated when moving an
	  item to the end of the list. This makes Asterisk endlessy loop
	  whenever it needs to read the list. Jids with different resource
	  and priority values, like in Gmail's and GoogleTalk's jabber
	  clients put that problem in evidence. Upon reception of a 'from'
	  attribute with an empty resource string, Asterisk crashes when
	  trying to access the found->cap pointer if the resource list for
	  the given buddy is not empty. This situation is perfectly valid
	  and must be handled. The Gizmoproject's jabber client put that
	  problem in evidence. Also added a few comments in the code as
	  well as a handle for the capabilities from Gmail's jabber client,
	  which are stored in a caps:c tag rather than the usual c tag.
	  Closes issue #10184.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Don't call find_peer in
	  registry_authrequest with the pvt lock held to avoid a deadlock.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Release the pvt lock before calling
	  find_peer in register_verify to avoid a deadlock. Also, remove
	  some unnecessary locking in auth_fail that was only done
	  recursively.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Don't call find_peer within update_registry
	  with a pvt lock held. This can cause a deadlock as the code will
	  eventually call find_callno.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: I am fighting deadlocks in chan_iax2. I
	  have tracked them down to a single core issue. You can not call
	  find_callno() while holding a pvt lock as this function has to
	  lock another (every) other pvt lock. Doing so can lead to a
	  classic deadlock. So, I am tracking down all of the code paths
	  where this can happen and fixing them. The fix I committed
	  earlier today was along the same theme. This patch fixes some
	  code down the path of authenticate_reply.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Removing some extra debug code I left in my
	  last commit

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Quite a few changes regarding IMAP storage.
	  1. instead of using inboxcount as the core message counting
	  function, we use messagecount instead. This makes it possible to
	  count messages in folders besides just INBOX and Old. 2.
	  inboxcount and hasvoicemail now use messagecount as their means
	  of determining return values. 3. Added a copy_message function
	  for IMAP storage. Unfortunately I don't have the means to test
	  it, but it seems like a pretty straightforward function. 4.
	  Removed a #ifndef IMAP_STORAGE and matching #endif from
	  leave_voicemail for a couple of reasons. One, we want to support
	  copying mail to multiple IMAP boxes, and two, IMAP was broken
	  because a STORE macro had been moved into this section of code.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: I broke canreinvite...Now I'm fixing it. I
	  put some new code in the wrong place and so I've reverted the
	  canreinvite section to how it was and put my new code where it
	  should be.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: add a comment to indicate that inboxcount
	  for ODBC_STORAGE needs to be fixed to support multiple mailboxes

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix subscriptions to multiple mailboxes for
	  ODBC_STORAGE. Also, leave a comment for this to be fixed for
	  IMAP_STORAGE, as well. I left IMAP alone since I know MarkM was
	  working on this code right now for another reason. This is broken
	  even worse in trunk, but for a different reason. The fact that
	  the mailbox option supported multiple mailboxes is completely not
	  obvious from the code in the channel drivers. Anyway, I will fix
	  that in another commit ...

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Fix a problem with the combination of the 'F'
	  option to pass DTMF through a conference and options that use
	  DTMF to activate various features. The problem was that the BEGIN
	  frame would be passed through, but the END frame would get
	  intercepted to activate a feature. Then, the other conference
	  members would hear DTMF for forever, which they didn't seem to
	  like very much. (closes issue #10400, reported by stevefeinstein,
	  fixed by me)

	  compiling with dev-mode and IMAP storage would not have any

	  my change uncovers a rather silly bit of logic.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Changing a bit of logic so that someone will
	  NEVER exit the queue on timeout unless they have enabled the 'n'
	  option. This commit relates to issue #10320. Thanks to

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix an issue where dynamic threads can get
	  free'd, but still exist in the dynamic thread list. (closes issue
	  #10392, patch from Mihai, with credit to his colleague, Pete)

	* include/asterisk/linkedlists.h: Fix the return value of
	  AST_LIST_REMOVE(). This shouldn't be causing any problems,
	  though, because the only code that uses the return value only
	  checks to see if it is NULL. (closes issue #10390, pointed out by

	* channels/chan_sip.c: It is possible for a transfer to occur

	* main/rtp.c: (closes issue #10355) Reported by: wdecarne Now that
	  we pass through RTP timestamp information we need to make the
	  allowed timestamp skew considerably less. There are situations
	  where a source may change and due to the timestamp difference the
	  receiver will experience an audio gap since we did not indicate
	  by setting the marker bit that the source changed.

	* configure, configure.ac: (closes issue #10383) Reported by: rizzo
	  Include stdlib.h so NULL gets defined for gethostbyname_r checks.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: If peer is not found, the error message is
	  misleading (should be peer not found, not ACL failure)

2007-08-03 20:25 +0000 [r78103]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* main/config.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/config.h:
	  Changed the behavior of sip's realtime_peer function to match the
	  corresponding way of matching for non-realtime peers. Now matches
	  are made on both the IP address and port number, or if the
	  insecure setting is set to "port" then just match on the IP
	  address. In order to accomplish this, I also added a new API
	  call, ast_category_root, which returns the first variable of an
	  ast_category struct

2007-08-03 20:14 +0000 [r78028-78101]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: (closes issue #10194) Reported by:
	  blitzrage Patches: bug0010194 uploaded by vovochka Tested by:
	  blitzrage Fix a problem when you call Voicemail() with multiple
	  mailboxes specified and ODBC_STORAGE is in use. The audio part of
	  the message was only given to the first mailbox specified.

	* main/utils.c, include/asterisk/lock.h, main/astmm.c: Add some
	  improvements to lock debugging. These changes take effect with
	  DEBUG_THREADS enabled and provide the following: * This will keep
	  track of which locks are held by which thread as well as which
	  lock a thread is waiting for in a thread-local data structure. A
	  reference to this structure is available on the stack in the
	  dummy_start() function, which is the common entry point for all
	  threads. This information can be easily retrieved using gdb if
	  you switch to the dummy_start() stack frame of any thread and
	  print the contents of the lock_info variable. * All of the
	  thread-local structures for keeping track of this lock
	  information are also stored in a list so that the information can
	  be dumped to the CLI using the "core show locks" CLI command.
	  This introduces a little bit of a performance hit as it requires
	  additional underlying locking operations inside of every
	  lock/unlock on an ast_mutex. However, the benefits of having this
	  information available at the CLI is huge, especially considering
	  this is only done in DEBUG_THREADS mode. It means that in most
	  cases where we debug deadlocks, we no longer have to request
	  access to the machine to analyze the contents of ast_mutex_t
	  structures. We can now just ask them to get the output of "core
	  show locks", which gives us all of the information we needed in
	  most cases. I also had to make some additional changes to astmm.c
	  to make this work when both MALLOC_DEBUG and DEBUG_THREADS are
	  enabled. I disabled tracking of one of the locks in astmm.c
	  because it gets used inside the replacement memory allocation
	  routines, and the lock tracking code allocates memory. This
	  caused infinite recursion.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Only pass through HOLD and UNHOLD control
	  frames when the mohinterpret option is set to "passthrough". This
	  was pointed out by Kevin in the middle of a training session.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Don't reuse the timespec that was set to 0
	  in the previous timedwait as it will just return immediately.
	  Also, fix some logic so the thread's lock isn't unlocked twice in
	  the weird case of dynamic threads getting acquired right after a
	  timeout. (pointed out by SteveK)

	* channels/chan_skinny.c, configs/skinny.conf.sample: Make sure we
	  actually allow 6 chars to be sent. Also make note of the "A"
	  option of date format. Issue 9779, modifications by DEA, wedhorn,
	  and myself.

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: If a device disconnects, the session will
	  go away. If this happens during call setup, we need to give up.
	  Issue 10325.

2007-08-02 19:25 +0000 [r77949]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix the case where a dynamic thread times
	  out waiting for something to do during the first time it runs.
	  This shouldn't ever happen, but we should account for it anyway.
	  (pointed out by pete, who works with mihai)

2007-08-02 18:42 +0000 [r77947]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Make sure we clear the prompt status
	  message on a hangup. Also rearrange messages to better fit with
	  what a wireshark trace shows it should be. Issue 10299, initial
	  patch and solution by sbisker, modified by me to fit with
	  wireshark trace.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix another race condition in the handling
	  of dynamic threads. If the dynamic thread timed out waiting for
	  something to do, but was acquired to perform an action
	  immediately afterwords, then wait on the condition again to give
	  the other thread a chance to finish setting up the data for what
	  action this thread should perform. Otherwise, if it immediately
	  continues, it will perform the wrong action. (reported on IRC by
	  mihai, patch by me) (related to issue #10289)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Add another sanity check to
	  vnak_retransmit(). This check ensures that frames that have
	  already been marked for deletion don't get retransmitted. (closes
	  issue #10361, patch from mihai)

2007-08-02 15:15 +0000 [r77890-77894]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	  s" Issue 10358, initial patch by DEA, reworked by me to use S_OR,
	  tested by sbisker

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Put in some additional debug information
	  for softkey/stimulus messages. Issue 10291, patch by DEA.

2007-08-01 22:16 +0000 [r77887]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix some race conditions which have been
	  causing weird problems in chan_iax2. The most notable problem is
	  that people have been seeing storms of VNAK frames being sent due
	  to really old frames mysteriously being in the retransmission
	  queue and never getting removed. It was possible that a dynamic
	  thread got created, but did not acquire its lock before the
	  thread that created it signals it to perform an action. When this
	  happens, the thread will sleep until it hits a timeout, and then
	  get destroyed. So, the action never gets performed and in some
	  cases, means a frame doesn't get transmitted and never gets freed
	  since the scheduler never gets a chance to reschedule
	  transmission. Another less severe race condition is in the
	  handling of a timeout for a dynamic thread. It was possible for
	  it to be acquired to perform at action at the same time that it
	  hit a timeout. When this occurs, whatever action it was acquired
	  for would never get performed. (patch contributed by Mihai and
	  SteveK) (closes issue #10289) (closes issue #10248) (closes issue
	  #10232) (possibly related to issue #10359)

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Fix an issue that caused one-way audio on
	  some newer devices (specifically the 7921), due to sending
	  packets in the wrong order during hangup. Also make sure we clear
	  tones/messages on the correct line/instance. Issue 10291, patch
	  by DEA, tested by sbisker and myself.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fixes an issue I introduced to queues wherein a
	  queue with joinempty=yes would kick people out of the queue
	  because of erroneously thinking the 'n' option was in use.
	  (closes issue #10320, reported by jfitzgibbon, patched by me,
	  tested by blitzrage and me) Thank you blitzrage for all the
	  testing you've done lately with queues! It's much appreciated!

	* apps/app_queue.c: If a queue uses dynamic realtime members, then
	  the member list should be updated after each attempt to call the
	  queue. This fixes an issue where if a caller calls into a queue
	  where no one is logged in, they would wait forever even if a
	  member logged in at some point. (closes issue #10346, reported by

	* channels/chan_sip.c: This patch makes Asterisk send 100 Trying
	  provisional responses upon receipt of re-invites. This makes it
	  so that if there are two or more Asterisk servers between

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix an issue that could potentially cause
	  corruption of the global iax frame queue. In the network_thread()
	  loop, it traverses the list using the AST_LIST_TRAVERSE_SAFE
	  macro. However, to remove an element of the list within this
	  loop, it used AST_LIST_REMOVE, instead of
	  AST_LIST_REMOVE_CURRENT, which I believe could leave some of the
	  internal variables of the SAFE macro invalid. Mihai says that he
	  already made this change in his local copy and it didn't help his
	  VNAK storm issues, but I still think it's wrong. :)

	  define it in the same way that trunk does. Also, revert the
	  change that added this define in the Makefile The advantage to
	  doing it this way is that buildopts.h gets installed when you
	  install Asterisk. Then, when building any out of tree modules, or
	  building asterisk-addons, these modules know which options the
	  rest of Asterisk was built with.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Added a membercount variable to call_queue
	  struct which keeps track of the number of logged in members in a
	  particular queue. This makes it so that the 'n' option for
	  Queue() can act properly depending on which strategy is used. If
	  the strategy is roundrobin, rrmemory, or ringall, we want to ring
	  each phone once before moving on in the dialplan. However, if any
	  other strategy is used, we will only ring one phone since it
	  cannot be guaranteed that a different phone will ring on
	  subsequent attempts to ring a phone. As a side effect of this,
	  the QUEUE_MEMBER_COUNT dialplan function now just reads the
	  membercount variable instead of traversing through the member
	  list to figure out how many members there are. Special thanks to
	  blitzrage for helping to test this out. (closes issue #10127,

	  12 lines (closes issue #9660) Reported by: mmacvicar Patches
	  submitted by: bbryant, russell Tested by: mmacvicar, marco,
	  arcivanov, jmhunter, explidous When using a TDM400P (and probably
	  other analog cards) there was a chance that you could hang up and
	  pick the phone back up where it has been long enough to be not
	  considered a flash hook, but too soon such that the device
	  reports that it is busy and the person on the phone will only
	  hear silence. This patch makes chan_zap more tolerant of this and
	  gives the device a couple of seconds to succeed so the person on
	  the phone happily gets their dialtone. ........

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: A few changes, the ultimate goal of which
	  is to keep better track of the number of messages that a mailbox
	  currently has. A description of the changes: 1. Changed the
	  "updated" field of the vm_state struct to act more as a binary
	  semaphore than a counting semaphore, since its current
	  implementation made the inboxcount function not work properly.
	  This change falls in line with a change made by UPenn with their
	  IMAP setup and helps to sync our changes with theirs. 2.
	  Eliminated some redundant calls to get_vm_state_by_mailbox inside
	  leave_voicemail 3. Use the play_folder variable to keep track of
	  the number of old and new messages in a mailbox as the messages
	  are deleted 4. Added an increment to the number of new messages
	  that was not there previously in the leave_voicemail function

	  amaflags to some other value, you will see that all CDRs have had
	  their amaflags changed. This is not good. So I fixed it. ........

	* main/channel.c: In ast_channel_make_compatible(), just return if
	  the channels' read and write formats already match up. There are
	  code paths that call this function on a pair of channels multiple
	  times. This made calls fail that were using g729 in some cases.
	  The reason is that codec_g729a will unregister itself from the
	  list of available translators will all licenses are in use. So,
	  the first time the function got called, the right translation
	  path was allocated. However, the second time it got called, the
	  code would not find a translation path to/from g729 and make the
	  call fail, even if the channel actually already had a g729
	  translation path allocated. (SPD-32)

	* res/res_jabber.c: Ok, we found out that this is not about if you
	  have any *active* clients using TLS, but if you have initialized

	* res/res_jabber.c: If you have a jabber client that uses TLS,
	  refuse unload. Bad fix, but will prevent crashes while we are
	  trying to find a workaround. Iksemel development seems to have
	  stalled and we might have to stop using the TCP/TLS connections
	  in that library and use our own, which would scale better from a
	  poll/select perspective I guess. It would also make it easier to
	  migrate to OpenSSL and stop Asterisk from depending on both
	  OpenSSL and GnuTLS.

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Fix for skinny keepalives. If there is no
	  traffic from the phone for (keep_alive * 1100) ms (arbitrarily
	  adding 10% for network issues, etc), unregister the device. Issue
	  8394, patch by DEA.

	* channels/chan_mgcp.c: Fixes for dtmf/dialing with mgcp (similar
	  to the recent fix for chan_skinny) Issue 9855, patch by DEA.

2007-06-04 22:28 +0000 [r67119]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Add comments for two functions that get
	  called with the appropriate call locked, but perform operations
	  that could result in the pvt structure getting destroyed before
	  returning again, causing numerous seg faults all over the module.
	  (inspired by issues #9642, #9569, and #9666, and the work done by
	  stevedavies and mihai)

	* apps/app_dial.c: Initialize cidname variable to nothing since it
	  may be used without having been touched. (issue #9661 reported by
	  dimas)

	* res/res_features.c: Returning a value that indicates the parking
	  of a call was a success when it really wasn't (because the
	  parking slot selected was in use) is the wrong thing to do.
	  (issue #9723 reported by mdu113)

	  handling an implicit ACK to a frame that was marked as the final
	  transmission for a call, don't call iax2_destroy() for that call
	  while the global frame queue is still locked. There is a very

	  line This update will fix the situation that occurs as described
	  by 9717, where when several targets are specified for a dial, if
	  any one them reports FAIL, the whole call gets FAIL, even though
	  others were ringing OK. I rearranged the priorities, so that a
	  new disposition, NULL, is at the lowest level, and the
	  disposition get init'd to NULL. Then, next up is FAIL, and next
	  up is BUSY, then NOANSWER, then ANSWERED. All the related set
	  routines will only do so if the disposition value to be set to is
	  greater than what's already there. This gives the intended
	  effect. So, if all the targets are busy, you'd get BUSY for the
	  call disposition. If all get BUSY, but one, and that one rings is
	  not answered, you get NOANSWER. If by some freak of nature, the
	  NULL value doesn't get overridden, then the disp2str routine will
	  report NOANSWER as before. ........

	* main/channel.c: Fix YADB (Yet Another DTMF Bug) ((C) Russell
	  Bryant, 2007, TM, Patent Pending). This set of changes came from
	  a debugging session I had with Dwayne Hubbard. When he called
	  into his home FXO, ran the Echo application, and pressed a digit,
	  the digit would be echoed back and would never end. This is
	  fixed, along with a couple other little improvements. * When
	  chan_zap is in the middle of playing a digit to a channel, it
	  feeds back null frames, not voice frames. So, I have modified
	  ast_read to check the timing on emulated DTMF when it receives
	  null frames, in addition to where it was doing this on voice
	  frames. * Make a tweak to setting the duration on emulated DTMF
	  digits. If there was no duration specified, it set it to be the
	  minimum, instead of the default. * Instead of timing the emulated
	  digits off of the number of samples in audio frames that pass
	  through, just use time values. Now there is no code in this
	  section that assumes 8kHz audio.

	* main/channel.c: Merge changes from team/russell/inband_dtmf ...
	  Fix some issues related to generating inband DTMF. There are two
	  changes here: 1) The list of DTMF tones in the senddigit_begin()
	  function explicitly specified 100ms of the tone followed by 100ms
	  of silence. This really broke things with the way that Asterisk
	  now wants complete control over when the digit begins and ends.
	  So, regardless of what Asterisk really wanted to do, this was
	  going to play out the tone at the length it wanted to. This
	  caused various problems like DTMF translation to inband to be
	  extremely unreliable. The list of tones has been changed so that
	  the correct DTMF tone is played indefinitely until Asterisk tells
	  it to stop. 2) ast_write() had to be modified to let a DTMF_END
	  frame get processed even when a generator is present. This is how
	  the tone will finally get stopped. (issues #8944, #9250, #9348,
	  maybe others. Thanks to mdu113 from #8944 for the testing and
	  feedback!)

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fix a weird problem where when a caller
	  talking to someone sitting behind an agent channel sent a digit,
	  the digit would be played to the agent for forever. This is
	  because chan_agent always returned -1 from its send_digit_begin
	  and _end callbacks. This non-zero return value indicates to the
	  Asterisk core that it would like an inband DTMF generator put on
	  the channel. However, this is the wrong thing to do. It should
	  *always* return 0, instead. When the digit begin and end
	  functions are called on the proxied channel, the underlying
	  channel will indicate whether inband DTMF is needed or not, and
	  the generator will be put on that one, and not the Agent channel.

	  that was intended to be a part of this system, but was never
	  actually implemented, was the ability for the GUI to be able to
	  upload files to Asterisk. So, this commit adds this in the most
	  minimally invasive way that we could come up with. A lot of work
	  on minimime was done by Steve Murphy. He fixed a lot of bugs in
	  the parser, and updated it to be thread-safe. The ability to
	  check permissions of active manager sessions was added by Dwayne
	  Hubbard. Then, hacking this all together and do doing the
	  modifications necessary to the HTTP interface was done by me.

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Fix a few problems with SLA. (issue #9459,
	  reported by francesco_r, fixed by me) * The original behavior was
	  that if one station put a call on hold, another one picked it up,
	  and then hung up, the code would still consider the call on hold
	  by the first station, so the trunk would not be hung up. However,
	  to better comply with what most people seem to expect it to
	  behave, it will now hang up the trunk. * Fix a problem with
	  "barge=no". This was only intended to prevent people from joining
	  calls that are in progress. However, it also prevented other
	  people from picking up a call that was on hold. This has been
	  fixed. * When there are no active stations on a trunk and it is
	  on hold, the code now indicates the HOLD and UNHOLD conditions to
	  the trunk channel. This allows music on hold to be played to the
	  trunk when it is on hold.

	  5 lines If an error occurs when reading from an RTP socket, and

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: When the IAX2 read callback gets called,

	  However, the author of this patch says an error will occur that
	  will cause it to get called every 100 thousand calls or so. When
	  this does happen, it puts the channel in a loop that eventually
	  brings down the system. So, hangup up the call is certainly a

	  option to enable it for those that would like to use it anyway.
	  The short story behind this is that to properly handle CallerID
	  with SLA, we need the ability to change the CallerID on an
	  existing call, and we are not ready to handle that.

	  things. However, I got tired of doing it in plain text, so I
	  switched to using LaTeX. I have included the PDF version. I
	  haven't been able to get a nice looking plain text version out of

	  7 lines Fix a problem where the Asterisk channel name could be
	  that of the wrong IAX2 user for a call. This is because the first
	  step of choosing this name is to look for an IAX2 peer that
	  happens to have the same IP/port number that this call is coming
	  from and assuming that is it. However, this is not always
	  correct. So, I have made it change this name after authentication
	  happens since at that point, we have an exact match. ........

	  when using a Local channel on the trunk side in SLA. The
	  station's channel needs to be passed to the dial API when dialing
	  the trunk. * Change a WARNING message to DEBUG in channel.h. This

	  were changed in the code from "\n" to "\r\n". However, this
	  breaks sending regular voicemail to email. So, this change
	  conditionally sets line endings to "\r\n" only if IMAP_STORAGE is
	  enabled. (issue #9128, patch by jarjarbinks, modified by me to
	  not break IMAP storage)

	  made the SLA code event driven instead of having to act in a lot
	  of busy loops while dialing things to wait for state changes.
	  This makes the code more efficient and readable at the same time.
	  * I have implemented a couple of new features. The first is
	  inbound trunk ringing timeouts. This is an option that defines
	  how long to let an incoming call on a trunk to ring. * I have
	  also implemented ring timeouts for stations. They may be
	  specified for the entire station, meaning it is how long to let
	  the station ring before giving up. You can also specify a ring
	  timeout for a specific trunk on a station. So, you can say that
	  you only want a specific station to ring 5 seconds if it is line1
	  ringing, but otherwise, there is no timeout.

	  inherit information from.

	* apps/app_echo.c: When the Echo() application receives the digit
	  '#', echo that back as well. Since we already sent the BEGIN

	  part, and the high 16 bits of the fractional part. However, the
	  code here was erroneously taking the low 16 bits of the
	  fractional part. It then shifted the result 16 bits down, so the
	  result was always zero. This fix makes it grab the appropriate
	  high 16 bits, instead. (issue #8991, pointed out by
	  andre_abrantes)

	  9 lines The SIGHUP handler was implemented to allow admins to
	  send SIGHUP to a running Asterisk process to reload the
	  configuration. However, doing the actual reload in the signal
	  handler itself is a very bad thing to do, because the reload
	  process includes calling non-reentrant functions such as
	  malloc/calloc/etc. If Asterisk is running in the background, then
	  the reload will happen immediately. However, if running in
	  console mode, the reload doesn't work until something is typed at
	  the console. That sort of defeats the purpose, but I don't see an

	* main/manager.c: The session lock can not be held while calling

	  8711, there still may be an issue. If there is a second action
	  requested before the processing of the first action is finished,

	  used to build the result. (issue #8711, #8934)

	  channels/chan_iax2.c: Merge the changes from the
	  /team/group/vldtmf_fixup branch. The main bug being addressed
	  here is a problem introduced when two SIP channels using SIP INFO
	  dtmf have their media directly bridged. So, when a DTMF END frame
	  comes into Asterisk from an incoming INFO message, Asterisk would
	  try to emulate a digit of some length by first sending a DTMF
	  BEGIN frame and sending a DTMF END later timed off of incoming
	  audio. However, since there was no audio coming in, the DTMF_END
	  was never generated. This caused DTMF based features to no longer
	  work. To fix this, the core now knows when a channel doesn't care
	  about DTMF BEGIN frames (such as a SIP channel sending INFO
	  dtmf). If this is the case, then Asterisk will not emulate a
	  digit of some length, and will instead just pass through the
	  single DTMF END event. Channel drivers also now get passed the
	  length of the digit to their digit_end callback. This improves
	  SIP INFO support even further by enabling us to put the real
	  digit duration in the INFO message instead of a hard coded 250ms.
	  Also, for an incoming INFO message, the duration is read from the
	  frame and passed into the core instead of just getting ignored.

	* Makefile, Makefile.rules: various Makefile improvements to get
	  chan_vpb (and any other C++ modules) to build properly

2007-01-03 01:19 +0000 [r49259]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Check pvt structure presence before passing
	  to send_command. This gets rid of the irritating message about a
	  packet without pvt structure. This happens because the scheduled
	  item is getting cancelled at almost the exact moment it is
	  getting executed.

2007-01-02 22:30 +0000 [r49237]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/ast_expr2.fl, main/ast_expr2f.c, pbx/ael/ael_lex.c,
	  pbx/ael/ael.flex: This is a slight modification to Josh's edits
	  for #8579; both files edited were the produced by flex; so the
	  source files need to be changed instead, and the generated files
	  regenerated.

2007-01-02 19:58 +0000 [r49212]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Small cleanup of add_t38sdp - it's always
	  enabled at that point in the code

2007-01-01 23:34 +0000 [r49098-49102]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c, build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure,
	  configure.ac, codecs/codec_zap.c: check specifically for VLDTMF
	  and transcoding support in the system's Zaptel installation, and
	  make only the modules that need those features dependent on them
	  (this will allow building the other Zaptel-using parts of
	  Asterisk against older versions of Zaptel or those on other
	  platforms that haven't caught up yet to the Linux version)

	* Makefile: use a simpler (and portable) method to ensure that
	  menuselect is built as a host binary

	* Makefile: revert this change until a better solution can be
	  found... 'env -i' was not being used properly, but even when
	  changed to do so, this process fails during cross-compilation
	  because the menuselect build still sees 'CC' as set to the
	  cross-compiler

	  we had better use IAX2 when creating the dial string for users.
	  (issue #8697 reported by ssokol)

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Use asprintf to build the channel names
	  instead of custom function. I believe the custom function is
	  doing some things that are not portable across all
	  implementations. (issue #8570 reported by hterag & issue #8692

	  of a masquerade then attempt to read a frame in so the masquerade
	  actually happens. Otherwise weirdness will occur. (issue #8696
	  reported by kjotte)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Initialize the packet queue in load_module
	  instead of just declaring the list with the default value. (issue

2006-12-30 00:40 +0000 [r49061]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

2006-12-27 22:28 +0000 [r49009]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* main/ast_expr2f.c, pbx/ael/ael_lex.c: ast_copy_string is not

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Be a bit more

	  widespread so we try to implement a fix while waiting for a
	  bugfix from Cisco.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: - Make sure handle_common_options return 1
	  when we found a common option - Move uncommon (only global)
	  option away from handle_common_options Reported by rizzo. Thanks!

	* main/rtp.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/rtp.h: Add an

	  purposes, and the API calls that are used rely on the lock.
	  (Pointed out on asterisk-dev by Andy Wang)

	* codecs/lpc10/Makefile, main/Makefile, codecs/gsm/Makefile,

	  utils/ael_main.c: remove some now-unnecessary explicit includes
	  of autoconfig.h clean up per-file dependencies during 'make
	  clean'

	* build_tools/prep_tarball: need an additional argument here to
	  make the downloads actually occur

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  acinclude.m4: use m4 quoting for AC_MSG_NOTICE calls, to keep
	  these calls from thinking they have multiple arguments

	* codecs/ilbc, formats, utils/Makefile, agi/Makefile, Makefile,

	  simplify dependency tracking system, using the compiler's
	  built-in method for generating them, and only doing dependency
	  tracking if developer mode is enabled via the configure script

	* Makefile, include/asterisk.h, main/stdtime/localtime.c: since we
	  really, really have to have autoconfig.h included before all
	  other headers (especially system headers), the Makefile will now
	  force it to happen (this will fix build problems with files like
	  ast_expr2f.c, where we can't control the inclusion order in the
	  file itself)

	* funcs/func_curl.c: instead of initializing the curl library every
	  time the CURL() function is invoked, do it only once per thread
	  (this allows multiple calls to CURL() in the dialplan for a
	  channel to run much more quickly, and also to re-use connections
	  to the server) (thanks to JerJer for frequently complaining about
	  this performance problem)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Use a wakeup variable so that we don't wait
	  on IO indefinitely if packets need to be retransmitted.

	* main/rtp.c, include/asterisk/rtp.h: Payload values on the RTP
	  structure can change AFTER a bridge has started. This comes from
	  the packet handling of the SIP response when indication that it
	  was answered has been sent. Therefore we need to protect this
	  data with a lock when we read/write. (issue #8232 reported by
	  tgrman)

	* main/rtp.c: Remove direct RTCP bridging. I've come to the
	  conclusion that we should handle this through the core and not
	  just forward it on. Should solve a few bugs.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Use locking when accessing the
	  registrations list. This list is not actually used very often, so
	  the likelihood of there being a problem is pretty small, but
	  still possible. For example, if the CLI command to list the
	  registrations was called at the same time that a reload was
	  occurring and the registrations list was getting destroyed and
	  rebuilt, a crash could occur. In passing, go ahead and convert
	  this list to use the linked list macros.

	  queues, setting a call limit per SIP device is propably a
	  requirement. In most cases, it will work much better if you only
	  use type=peer and not type=friend. We might decide to backport
	  the new setting from trunk to apply all call limits to the peer
	  part of a friend only.

	  9 lines soxmix and Asterisk expect different file extensions for
	  certain formats. This was already handled for the wav49 format.
	  However, it was not handled for ulaw and alaw. I fixed this in

	  will only happen if we know we're calling soxmix, and not a
	  custom script defined using the MONITOR_EXEC variable. The wav49
	  processing was left alone so that external scripts will see no

	  return -1. This value of -1 was then being used as an array index
	  in these loops, which caused a crash on some systems. Other than
	  this issue, this code works as we expected it to. If a format is

2006-10-20 07:44 +0000 [r45741]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Let's understand SIP: - REFER can create
	  dialog, Asterisk does not support it yet - NOTIFY can create
	  dialog in Asterisk's implementation (voicemail) even though we
	  don't support the server side of it. In this case, the standard
	  is a side issue ;-) - Added extened functionality for unsupported
	  methods (PING, PUBLISH) so we don't create PVT's for those
	  either. Russellb needs to judge what to do with this in 1.2, but
	  I think the current implementation n 1.2 is a bug since we're
	  sending bad replies to NOTIFY and REFER outside of dialogs

	* main/rtp.c: Remove the seqno check for RFC2833, the handler is
	  smart enough to not need it.

	* CHANGES: various cleanups

2006-10-06 18:46 +0000 [r44581-44605]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* main/rtp.c: When the sequence number rolls over then reset the
	  recorded sequence number for DTMF (issue #8106 reported by
	  bungalow)

	* main/file.c: Even more frames to treat as though the remote side
	  disappeared (issue #8097 reported by eldadran)

2006-10-06 15:59 +0000 [r44567]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

2006-10-06 12:53 +0000 [r44559-44563]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed segfault which happens during
	  hold/transfer action

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: if INFORMATION Message come with keypad
	  instead of called party number, we just use the keypad as called
	  party number.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn_config.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h, configs/misdn.conf.sample:
	  added the option 'reject_cause' to make it possible to set
	  the RELEASE_COMPLETE - cause on the 3. incoming PMP channel,
	  which is automatically rejected because chan_misdn does not
	  support that kind of callwaiting. Therefore chan_misdn supports
	  now 3 incoming channels on a PMP BRI Port. misdn_lib_get_free_bc
	  now gets the info if the requested channel is incoming or
	  outgoing to make the 3. channel possible

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h,
	  channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed the hold/retrieve/transfer issues,
	  removed a useless bc field, added setting of frame.delivery fields,
	  some minor code cleanups

	* CHANGES: I put the accumulated changes from the commit logs and
	  inspection, into CHANGES. Hope everyone approves!

	* configs/muted.conf.sample, utils/muted.c: Hang on a minute, the
	  install process sticks muted.conf in /etc/asterisk, so that's
	  where muted should look for it, right?

2006-10-05 02:40 +0000 [r44450]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

2006-10-01 18:30 +0000 [r44111-44125]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* Makefile: Fix a problem that cuased AST_DATA_DIR in defaults.h to
	  be empty. The cause is that since ASTDATADIR is explicitly
	  exported using "export ASTDATADIR" at the top of the Makefile,
	  make no longer considers the variable "undefined", so the
	  Makefile can't use ?= to set ASTDATADIR if not yet set. (issue
	  #8063, reported by akohlsmith, fixed by me)

	* configs/queues.conf.sample: Fix the name of the "eventmemberstatus"
	  option in the sample queues.conf (issue #8065, adamg)

2006-10-01 15:01 +0000 [r44109]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

2006-09-30 16:28 +0000 [r44080]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* codecs/lpc10/Makefile, Makefile, main/Makefile: fix two recent
	  build problems: - with AST_DEVMODE, building codecs/lpc10 fails
	  because of lots of warnings, and the configure step in editline
	  fails as well. Fix this by removing the -Werror in these steps. -
	  on FreeBSD (but probably on other platforms as well), the final
	  link of asterisk fails because AST_LIBS was not exported to the
	  subdirs Makefiles. Add a proper fix in the top-level Makefile (a
	  possible alternative way is to add "export AST_LIBS" near the
	  beginning of the file). With this fix, i believe that some of the
	  platform-specific conditionals in main/Makefile are redundant
	  (because they should be already dealt with in the top level
	  Makefile) but i don't have a platform to check. Merging to head
	  will happen in a moment.

2006-09-30 16:12 +0000 [r44068-44078]  Paul Cadach <paul@odt.east.telecom.kz>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix issue #7928 correctly. Next is a comment
	  of previous fix: Issue #7928 - Don't send both 404 and 503. Fix
	  by phsultan with a small fix by me, myself or I. Thanks,
	  Philippe! (This was caused by my changes to the transaction
	  handling)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Found some buggy SIP clients (phones Planet
	  VIP-153T firmware 1.0, Linksys PAP2 firmware 3.1.9(LSc)) which
	  sends ACK not on OK message only (when remote party answers) but
	  on RINGING message too, so when we send 200 OK message, we get
	  unidentified ACK message (because INVITE acknowledged on RINGING
	  message already), so 200 OK retransmits within its retransmission
	  interval then call gets dropped. If someone else knows how to
	  provide workaround for such cases, please, fix it in correct way.
	  Thanks to ssh from #asteriskru for provide access to his box to
	  study and fix this case.

	* channels/h323/ast_h323.cxx, channels/h323/ast_h323.h: Properly

	* main/db1-ast/Makefile, Makefile, codecs/Makefile, utils/Makefile,
	  main/Makefile, codecs/gsm/Makefile, Makefile.moddir_rules,
	  Makefile.rules, pbx/Makefile, channels/Makefile: don't abuse
	  CFLAGS and LDFLAGS for build of Asterisk components, because they
	  are also then used for non-Asterisk components (like menuselect);
	  use our own variables instead

	* configure, configure.ac: support --without-curl in configure
	  script

	* Makefile.rules: another cross-compile fix

	* Makefile: a couple more environment settings that can't leak into
	  the menuselect build

	* main/cli.c: proper fix for ast_group_t change

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: eliminate compiler warning when
	  DEBUG_CHANNEL_LOCKS is enabled and users of this header file

	  while checking their statuses. It's internal list of interfaces
	  includes the dial string, while the argument passed to this

	* main/channel.c,res/res_features.c: Fix a problem that occurred if
	  a user entered a digit
	  that matched a bridge feature that was configured using multiple
	  digits, and the digit that was pressed timed out in the feature
	  digit timeout period. For example, if blind transfer is
	  configured as '##', and a user presses just '#'. In this
	  situation, the call would lock up and no longer pass any frames.
	  (issue #7977 reported by festr, and issue #7982 reported by
	  michaels and valuable input provided by mneuhauser and kuj. Fixed
	  by me, with testing help and peer review from Joshua Colp). There
	  are a couple of issues involved in this fix: 1) When
	  ast_generic_bridge determines that there has been a timeout, it
	  returned AST_BRIDGE_RETRY. Then, when ast_channel_bridge gets
	  this result, it calls ast_generic_bridge over again with the same
	  timestamp for the next event. This results in an endless loop of
	  nothing until the call is terminated. This is resolved by simply
	  changing ast_generic_bridge to return AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE when it
	  sees a timeout. 2) I also changed ast_channel_bridge such that if
	  in the process of calculating the time until the next event, it
	  knows a timeout has already occured, to immediately return
	  AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE instead of attempting to bridge the channels
	  anyway. 3) In the process of testing the previous two changes, I
	  ran into a problem in res_features where ast_channel_bridge would
	  return because it determined that there was a timeout. However,
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features would then determine by its own
	  calculation that there was still 1 ms before the timeout really
	  occurs. It would then proceed, and since the bridge broke out and
	  did *not* return a frame, it interpreted this as the call was
	  over and hung up the channels. The reason for this was because
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features and ast_channel_bridge in
	  channel.c were using different times for their calculations.
	  channel.c uses the start_time on the bridge config, which is the
	  time that the feature digit was recieved. However, res_features
	  had another time, 'start', which was set right before calling
	  ast_channel_bridge. 'start' will always be slightly after
	  start_time in the bridge config, and sometimes enough to round up
	  to one ms. This is fixed by making ast_bridge_call use the same
	  time as ast_channel_bridge for the timeout calculation. ........

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/Makefile: removed the chan_misdn
	  versioning, since Asterisk has it's own

2006-09-27 16:23 +0000 [r43774]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make rfc2833compensate a global option.

2006-09-27 04:35 +0000 [r43756]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Backport revision 43754 from the trunk,
	  which removes an unused buffer from mm_login to close bug 8038,
	  as well as addresses some formatting and coding guidelines issues
	  in passing. Originally, I did not commit this to 1.4 since it is
	  not necessarily fixing a bug. However, since the IMAP storage
	  code is brand new, I decided it would be better to make the
	  change here as well, in case someone has to work on this code to
	  address issues in the very near future. I don't want to make
	  unnecessary merge problems going to the trunk.

2006-09-27 02:32 +0000 [r43739]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* configs/extensions.ael.sample: This change to extensions.ael was
	  to fix bug 8031; the install scripts are causing it to be copied
	  to /etc/asterisk/extensions.ael, and because it is a fairly
	  direct conversion of the original extensions.conf, the macro and
	  context names clash with the existing extensions.conf. So, I put
	  an ael- in front of all macros and contexts, and checked every
	  goto and macro call. Also, this file compiles under aelparse.

2006-09-26 20:56 +0000 [r43710]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/asterisk.c: Back in revision 4798, this message was changed from
	  using ast_cli() to directly calling write(). During this change,
	  checking if this was a remote console was removed. This caused
	  this message about using "exit" or "quit" to exit an Asterisk
	  console to come up in times where it did not make sense. This
	  change restores the check to see if this is a remote console
	  before printing the message. (fixes BE-65)

	* .cleancount, main/cli.c, channels/chan_sip.c,

2006-09-26 20:30 +0000 [r43700-43703]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add missing newline character in the warning
	  message about deprecated TOS values in configuration.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: When parsing the sections of voicemail.conf that contain
	  mailbox definitions, don't introduce a length limit on the
	  definition by using a 256 byte temporary storage buffer. Instead,
	  make the temporary buffer just as big as it needs to be to hold
	  the entire mailbox definition. (fixes BE-68)

2006-09-26 20:19 +0000 [r43695-43697]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_local.c: Strip options off the argument passed for
	  devicestate in chan_local. (issue #8034 reported by pcardozo)

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, main/channel.c, main/slinfactory.c: Slight
	  overhaul of the whisper support. 1. We need to duplicate the
	  frame from ast_translate 2. We need to ensure we always have
	  signed linear coming in for signed linear combining. 3. We need
	  to ensure we are always feeding signed linear out. 4. Properly
	  store and restore write format when beeping on the channel we are
	  whispering on. 5. Properly discontinue the stream on the channel
	  for the beep. (issue #8019 reported by timkelly1980)

	* doc/rtp-packetization.txt, main/frame.c: Issue #8015, patch by
	  Dan Austin. Maximum values were incorrect, which is why this is
	  being put in 1.4

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Add proper codec support to chan_skinny.
	  Works with at least ulaw, alaw, and g729a. This is technically a
	  "new feature", but there are justifications for it. I found a bug
	  with the recent rtp packetization changes, which caused the media
	  setup to fail under certain circumstances, particularly when
	  using allow=all, or having no allow= statements (globally or on
	  the device). I could have either removed the rtp packetization
	  features, or I could add proper codec support (which, without, I
	  think most people would consider to be a bug anyways).

	* channels/iax2-provision.c: Fix a CLI command registration issue
	  where an erroneous message claiming that "iax2 show provisioning"
	  was already registered. This was because this command was
	  registering itself as both the command, as well as the command it
	  is deprecating. (issue #8022, reported by bjweeks, fixed by
	  myself)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c:Check to see if the channel that is activating the
	  IAXPEER function is actually an IAX2 channel before proceeding to
	  process it to avoid crashing. (issue #8017, reported by admott,
