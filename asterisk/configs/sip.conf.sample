;
; SIP Configuration example for Asterisk
;
; Syntax for specifying a SIP device in extensions.conf is
; SIP/devicename where devicename is defined in a section below.
;
; You may also use 
; SIP/username@domain to call any SIP user on the Internet
; (Don't forget to enable DNS SRV records if you want to use this)
; 
; If you define a SIP proxy as a peer below, you may call
; SIP/proxyhostname/user or SIP/user@proxyhostname 
; where the proxyhostname is defined in a section below 
; 
; Useful CLI commands to check peers/users:
;   sip show peers                Show all SIP peers (including friends)
;   sip show users                Show all SIP users (including friends)
;   sip show registry             Show status of hosts we register with
;
;   sip debug                     Show all SIP messages
;
;   module reload chan_sip.so     Reload configuration file
;                                 Active SIP peers will not be reconfigured
;
;------- Naming devices ------------------------------------------------------
;
; When naming devices, make sure you understand how Asterisk matches calls
; that come in.
;	1. Asterisk checks the SIP From: address username and matches against
;	   names of devices with type=user 
;	   The name is the text between square brackets [name]
;	2. Asterisk checks the IP address (and port number) that the INVITE
;	   was sent from and matches against any devices with type=peer
;
; Don't mix extensions with the names of the devices. Devices need a unique
; name. The device name is *not* used as phone numbers. Phone numbers are
; anything you declare as an extension in the dialplan (extensions.conf).
;
; Note: The parameter "username" is not the username and in most cases is
;       not needed at all. Check below. In later releases, it's renamed
;       to "defaultuser" which is a better name, since it is used in 
;       combination with the "defaultip" setting.

; NoOp priority 1 extension for a given peer who registers or unregisters with

; Multiple contexts may be specified by separating them with '&'. The 
; actual extension is the 'regexten' parameter of the registering peer or its
; name if 'regexten' is not provided.  If more than one context is provided,
; the context must be specified within regexten by appending the desired
; context after '@'.  More than one regexten may be supplied if they are 
; separated by '&'.  Patterns may be used in regexten.

; The shrinkcallerid function removes '(', ' ', ')', non-trailing '.', and '-' not
; in square brackets.  For example, the caller id value 555.5555 becomes 5555555
; when this option is enabled.  Disabling this option results in no modification
; of the caller id value, which is necessary when the caller id represents something
; that must be preserved.  This option can only be used in the [general] section.
; By default this option is on.

;--------------------------- RTP timers ----------------------------------------------------

; are only applied to the audio channel.

; You can subscribe to the status of extensions with a "hint" priority
; (See extensions.conf.sample for examples)
; chan_sip support two major formats for notifications: dialog-info and SIMPLE 
;
; You will get more detailed reports (busy etc) if you have a call limit set
; for a device. When the call limit is filled, we will indicate busy. Note that
; you need at least 2 in order to be able to do attended transfers.
;
; For queues, you will need this level of detail in status reporting, regardless
; if you use SIP subscriptions. Queues and manager use the same internal interface
; for reading status information.
;
; Note: Subscriptions does not work if you have a realtime dialplan and use the
; realtime switch.
;
;allowsubscribe=no              ; Disable support for subscriptions. (Default is yes)

                                ; Turning on notifyringing and notifyhold will add a lot

;----------------------------------------- T.38 FAX PASSTHROUGH SUPPORT -----------------------
;
; This setting is available in the [general] section as well as in device configurations.
; Setting this to yes, enables T.38 fax (UDPTL) passthrough on SIP to SIP calls, provided
; both parties have T38 support enabled in their Asterisk configuration 
; This has to be enabled in the general section for all devices to work. You can then
; disable it on a per device basis. 
;
; T.38 faxing only works in SIP to SIP calls, with no local or agent channel being used.
;
; t38pt_udptl = yes            ; Default false
;
;----------------------------------------- OUTBOUND SIP REGISTRATIONS  ------------------------
; Asterisk can register as a SIP user agent to a SIP proxy (provider)
; Format for the register statement is:
;       register => user[:secret[:authuser]]@host[:port][/extension]
;
; If no extension is given, the 's' extension is used. The extension needs to
; be defined in extensions.conf to be able to accept calls from this SIP proxy
; (provider).
;
; host is either a host name defined in DNS or the name of a section defined
; below.
;
; Examples:
;
;register => 1234:password@mysipprovider.com        
;
;     This will pass incoming calls to the 's' extension
;
;
;register => 2345:password@sip_proxy/1234
;
;    Register 2345 at sip provider 'sip_proxy'.  Calls from this provider
;    connect to local extension 1234 in extensions.conf, default context,
;    unless you configure a [sip_proxy] section below, and configure a
;    context.
;    Tip 1: Avoid assigning hostname to a sip.conf section like [provider.com]
;    Tip 2: Use separate type=peer and type=user sections for SIP providers
;           (instead of type=friend) if you have calls in both directions
  
;registertimeout=20             ; retry registration calls every 20 seconds (default)
;registerattempts=10            ; Number of registration attempts before we give up
                                ; 0 = continue forever, hammering the other server
                                ; until it accepts the registration
                                ; Default is 0 tries, continue forever

;----------------------------------------- NAT SUPPORT ------------------------
; The externip, externhost and localnet settings are used if you use Asterisk
; behind a NAT device to communicate with services on the outside.

;externip = 200.201.202.203     ; Address that we're going to put in outbound SIP

; The nat= setting is used when Asterisk is on a public IP, communicating with
; devices hidden behind a NAT device (broadband router).  If you have one-way
; audio problems, you usually have problems with your NAT configuration or your
; firewall's support of SIP+RTP ports.  You configure Asterisk choice of RTP
; ports for incoming audio in rtp.conf
;

;----------------------------------- MEDIA HANDLING --------------------------------
; By default, Asterisk tries to re-invite the audio to an optimal path. If there's
; no reason for Asterisk to stay in the media path, the media will be redirected.
; This does not really work with in the case where Asterisk is outside and have
; clients on the inside of a NAT. In that case, you want to set canreinvite=nonat
;
;canreinvite=yes                ; Asterisk by default tries to redirect the
                                ; RTP media stream (audio) to go directly from
                                ; the caller to the callee.  Some devices do not
                                ; support this (especially if one of them is behind a NAT).
                                ; The default setting is YES. If you have all clients
                                ; behind a NAT, or for some other reason wants Asterisk to
                                ; stay in the audio path, you may want to turn this off.

;----------------------------------------- SIP DOMAIN SUPPORT ------------------------

; REGISTER to non-local domains will be automatically denied if a domain
; list is configured.
;
; Domains can be specified using:
; domain=<domain>[,<context>]
; Examples:
; domain=myasterisk.dom
; domain=customer.com,customer-context
;
; In addition, all the 'default' domains associated with a server should be
; added if incoming request filtering is desired.

[authentication]
; Global credentials for outbound calls, i.e. when a proxy challenges your
; Asterisk server for authentication. These credentials override
; any credentials in peer/register definition if realm is matched.
;
; This way, Asterisk can authenticate for outbound calls to other
; realms. We match realm on the proxy challenge and pick an set of 
; credentials from this list
; Syntax:
;        auth = <user>:<secret>@<realm>
;        auth = <user>#<md5secret>@<realm>
; Example:
;auth=mark:topsecret@digium.com
; 
; You may also add auth= statements to [peer] definitions 
; Peer auth= override all other authentication settings if we match on realm
