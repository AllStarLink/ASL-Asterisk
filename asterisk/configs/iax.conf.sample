; You can adjust several parameters relating to the jitter buffer.
; The jitter buffer's function is to compensate for varying
; network delay.
;
; All the jitter buffer settings are in milliseconds.
; The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound audio
; will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; jitterbuffer=yes|no: global default as to whether you want
; the jitter buffer at all.
;
; forcejitterbuffer=yes|no: in the ideal world, when we bridge VoIP channels
; we don't want to do jitterbuffering on the switch, since the endpoints
; can each handle this.  However, some endpoints may have poor jitterbuffers 
; themselves, so this option will force * to always jitterbuffer, even in this
; case.
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.

;trunkfreq=20			; How frequently to send trunk msgs (in ms)

; Should we send timestamps for the individual sub-frames within trunk frames?
; There is a small bandwidth use for these (less than 1kbps/call), but they
; ensure that frame timestamps get sent end-to-end properly.  If both ends of
; all your trunks go directly to TDM, _and_ your trunkfreq equals the frame
; length for your codecs, you can probably suppress these.  The receiver must
; also support this feature, although they do not also need to have it enabled.

; If regcontext is specified, Asterisk will dynamically create and destroy

; If we don't get ACK to our NEW within 2000ms, and autokill is set to yes,

; that is not available, but would be ill advised for bad connections.  In
; addition to 'yes' or 'no' you can also specify a number of milliseconds.
; See 'qualify' for individual peers to turn on for just a specific peer.

autokill=yes
;
; codecpriority controls the codec negotiation of an inbound IAX call.
; This option is inherited to all user entities.  It can also be defined 
; in each user entity separately which will override the setting in general.
;
; The valid values are:
;
; caller   - Consider the callers preferred order ahead of the host's.
; host     - Consider the host's preferred order ahead of the caller's.
; disabled - Disable the consideration of codec preference altogether.
;            (this is the original behaviour before preferences were added)
; reqonly  - Same as disabled, only do not consider capabilities if
;            the requested format is not available the call will only
;            be accepted if the requested format is available.
;
; The default value is 'host'
;
;codecpriority=host
;
; allowfwdownload controls whether this host will serve out firmware to
; IAX clients which request it.  This has only been used for the IAXy,
; and it has been recently proven that this firmware distribution method
; can be used as a source of traffic amplification attacks.  Also, the
; IAXy firmware has not been updated for at least 18 months, so unless
; you are provisioning IAXys in a secure network, we recommend that you
; leave this option to the default, off.
;
;allowfwdownload=yes

;rtcachefriends=yes	; Cache realtime friends by adding them to the internal list
			; just like friends added from the config file only on a
			; as-needed basis? (yes|no)

;rtupdate=yes		; Send registry updates to database using realtime? (yes|no)
			; If set to yes, when a IAX2 peer registers successfully,
			; the ip address, the origination port, the registration period,
			; and the username of the peer will be set to database via realtime.
			; If not present, defaults to 'yes'.

;rtautoclear=yes	; Auto-Expire friends created on the fly on the same schedule
			; as if it had just registered? (yes|no|<seconds>)
			; If set to yes, when the registration expires, the friend will
			; vanish from the configuration until requested again.
			; If set to an integer, friends expire within this number of
			; seconds instead of the registration interval.

;rtignoreregexpire=yes	; When reading a peer from Realtime, if the peer's registration
			; has expired based on its registration interval, used the stored
			; address information regardless. (yes|no)

;
; The following two options are used to disable call token validation for the
; purposes of interoperability with IAX2 endpoints that do not yet support it.
;
; Call token validation can be set as optional for a single IP address or IP
; address range by using the 'calltokenoptional' option. 'calltokenoptional' is
; only a global option.  
;
;calltokenoptional=209.16.236.73/255.255.255.0
;
; By setting 'requirecalltoken=no', call token validation becomes optional for
; that peer/user.  By setting 'requirecalltoken=auto', call token validation 
; is optional until a call token supporting peer registers successfully using
; call token validation.  This is used as an indication that from now on, we
; can require it from this peer.  So, requirecalltoken is internally set to yes.
; requirecalltoken may only be used in peer/user/friend definitions,
; not in the global scope.
; By default, 'requirecalltoken=yes'.
;
;requirecalltoken=no
;

;
; These options are used to limit the amount of call numbers allocated to a
; single IP address.  Before changing any of these values, it is highly encouraged
; to read the user guide associated with these options first.  In most cases, the
; default values for these options are sufficient.
;
; The 'maxcallnumbers' option limits the amount of call numbers allowed for each
; individual remote IP address.  Once an IP address reaches it's call number
; limit, no more new connections are allowed until the previous ones close.  This
; option can be used in a peer definition as well, but only takes effect for
; the IP of a dynamic peer after it completes registration.
;
;maxcallnumbers=512
;
; The 'maxcallnumbers_nonvalidated' is used to set the combined number of call
; numbers that can be allocated for connections where call token  validation
; has been disabled.  Unlike the 'maxcallnumbers' option, this limit is not
; separate for each individual IP address.  Any connection resulting in a
; non-call token validated call number being allocated contributes to this
; limit.  For use cases, see the call token user guide.  This option's 
; default value of 8192 should be sufficient in most cases.
;
;maxcallnumbers_nonvalidated=1024
;
; The [callnumberlimits] section allows custom call number limits to be set
; for specific IP addresses and IP address ranges.  These limits take precedence
; over the global 'maxcallnumbers' option, but may still be overridden by a
; peer defined 'maxcallnumbers' entry.  Note that these limits take effect
; for every individual address within the range, not the range as a whole. 
;
;[callnumberlimits]

; The shrinkcallerid function removes '(', ' ', ')', non-trailing '.', and '-' not
; in square brackets.  For example, the caller id value 555.5555 becomes 5555555
; when this option is enabled.  Disabling this option results in no modification
; of the caller id value, which is necessary when the caller id represents something
; that must be preserved.  This option can only be used in the [general] section.
; By default this option is on.

; which case the first will be the default.  You can also override caller*ID
; so that when you receive a call you set the Caller*ID to be what you want
; instead of trusting what the remote user provides
;
; There are three authentication methods that are supported:  md5, plaintext,
; and rsa.  The least secure is "plaintext", which sends passwords cleartext
; across the net.  "md5" uses a challenge/response md5 sum arrangement, but
; still requires both ends have plain text access to the secret.  "rsa" allows
; unidirectional secret knowledge through public/private keys.  If "rsa"
; authentication is used, "inkeys" is a list of acceptable public keys on the 
; local system that can be used to authenticate the remote peer, separated by
; the ":" character.  "outkey" is a single, private key to use to authenticate
; to the other side.  Public keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.pub
; while private keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.key.  Private
; keys should always be 3DES encrypted.
