[general]
; Formats for writing Voicemail.  Note that when using IMAP storage for
; voicemail, only the first format specified will be used.
;format=g723sf|wav49|wav
format=wav49|gsm|wav
;
; WARNING:
; If you change the list of formats that you record voicemail in
; when you have mailboxes that contain messages, you _MUST_ absolutely
; manually go through those mailboxes and convert/delete/add the
; the message files so that they appear to have been stored using
; your new format list. If you don't do this, very unpleasant
; things may happen to your users while they are retrieving and
; manipulating their voicemail.
;
; In other words: don't change the format list on a production system
; unless you are _VERY_  sure that you know what you are doing and are
; prepared for the consequences.
;
; Who the e-mail notification should appear to come from
serveremail=asterisk
;serveremail=asterisk@linux-support.net
; Should the email contain the voicemail as an attachment
attach=yes
; Maximum number of messages per folder.  If not specified, a default value
; (100) is used.  Maximum value for this option is 9999.
;maxmsg=100
; Maximum length of a voicemail message in seconds
;maxmessage=180
; Minimum length of a voicemail message in seconds for the message to be kept
; The default is no minimum.
;minmessage=3
; Maximum length of greetings in seconds
;maxgreet=60
; How many milliseconds to skip forward/back when rew/ff in message playback
skipms=3000
; How many seconds of silence before we end the recording
maxsilence=10
; Silence threshold (what we consider silence: the lower, the more sensitive)
silencethreshold=128
; Max number of failed login attempts
maxlogins=3
;
; User context is where entries from users.conf are registered.  The
; default value is 'default'
;
;userscontext=default
;
; If you need to have an external program, i.e. /usr/bin/myapp
; called when a voicemail is left, delivered, or your voicemailbox 
; is checked, uncomment this.  It can also be set to 'smdi' to use
; smdi for external notification.  If it is 'smdi', smdiport should
; be set to a valid port as specified in smdi.conf.

;externnotify=/usr/bin/myapp
;smdiport=/dev/ttyS0

; If you need to have an external program, i.e. /usr/bin/myapp
; called when a voicemail password is changed, uncomment this:
;externpass=/usr/bin/myapp
; For the directory, you can override the intro file if you want
;directoryintro=dir-intro
; The character set for voicemail messages can be specified here
;charset=ISO-8859-1
; The ADSI feature descriptor number to download to 
;adsifdn=0000000F
; The ADSI security lock code
;adsisec=9BDBF7AC
; The ADSI voicemail application version number.
;adsiver=1
; Skip the "[PBX]:" string from the message title
;pbxskip=yes
; Change the From: string
;fromstring=The Asterisk PBX
; Permit finding entries for forward/compose from the directory
;usedirectory=yes
; Voicemail can be stored in a database using the ODBC driver.
; The value of odbcstorage is the database connection configured
; in res_odbc.conf.
;odbcstorage=asterisk
; The default table for ODBC voicemail storage is voicemessages.
;odbctable=voicemessages
;
; Change the from, body and/or subject, variables:
;     VM_NAME, VM_DUR, VM_MSGNUM, VM_MAILBOX, VM_CALLERID, VM_CIDNUM,
;     VM_CIDNAME, VM_DATE
; Additionally, on forwarded messages, you have the variables:
;     ORIG_VM_CALLERID, ORIG_VM_CIDNUM, ORIG_VM_CIDNAME, ORIG_VM_DATE
; You can select between two variables by using dialplan functions, e.g.
;     ${IF(${ISNULL(${ORIG_VM_DATE})}?${VM_DATE}:${ORIG_VM_DATE})}
;
; Note: The emailbody config row can only be up to 512 characters due to a
;       limitation in the Asterisk configuration subsystem.
;emailsubject=[PBX]: New message ${VM_MSGNUM} in mailbox ${VM_MAILBOX}
; The following definition is very close to the default, but the default shows
; just the CIDNAME, if it is not null, otherwise just the CIDNUM, or "an unknown
; caller", if they are both null.
;emailbody=Dear ${VM_NAME}:\n\n\tjust wanted to let you know you were just left a ${VM_DUR} long message (number ${VM_MSGNUM})\nin mailbox ${VM_MAILBOX} from ${VM_CALLERID}, on ${VM_DATE}, so you might\nwant to check it when you get a chance.  Thanks!\n\n\t\t\t\t--Asterisk\n
;
; Note: ${IF()} strips spacing at the beginning and end of its true and false
; values, so a newline cannot be placed at either location.  The word 'so' is
; therefore duplicated, in order for the newline to be interpreted correctly.
;emailbody=Dear ${VM_NAME}:\n\n\tjust wanted to let you know you were just ${IF($["${VM_CIDNUM}" = "${ORIG_VM_CIDNUM}"]?left:forwarded)} a ${VM_DUR} long message (number ${VM_MSGNUM})\nin mailbox ${VM_MAILBOX} from ${VM_CALLERID}, on ${VM_DATE},\n${IF($["${VM_CIDNUM}" = "${ORIG_VM_CIDNUM}"]?so:(originally sent by ${ORIG_VM_CALLERID} on ${ORIG_VM_DATE})\nso)} you might want to check it when you get a chance.  Thanks!\n\n\t\t\t\t--Asterisk\n
;
; You can also change the Pager From: string, the pager body and/or subject.
; The above defined variables also can be used here
;pagerfromstring=The Asterisk PBX
;pagersubject=New VM
;pagerbody=New ${VM_DUR} long msg in box ${VM_MAILBOX}\nfrom ${VM_CALLERID}, on ${VM_DATE}
;
; Set the date format on outgoing mails. Valid arguments can be found on the
; strftime(3) man page
;
; Default
emaildateformat=%A, %B %d, %Y at %r
; 24h date format
;emaildateformat=%A, %d %B %Y at %H:%M:%S
;
; You can override the default program to send e-mail if you wish, too
;
;mailcmd=/usr/sbin/sendmail -t
; 
; Users may be located in different timezones, or may have different 
; message announcements for their introductory message when they enter 
; the voicemail system. Set the message and the timezone each user 
; hears here. Set the user into one of these zones with the tz= attribute 
; in the options field of the mailbox. Of course, language substitution 
; still applies here so you may have several directory trees that have 
; alternate language choices. 
; 
; Look in /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for names of timezones. 
; Look at the manual page for strftime for a quick tutorial on how the 
; variable substitution is done on the values below. 
; 
; Supported values: 
; 'filename'    filename of a soundfile (single ticks around the filename
;               required)
; ${VAR}        variable substitution 
; A or a        Day of week (Saturday, Sunday, ...) 
; B or b or h   Month name (January, February, ...) 
; d or e        numeric day of month (first, second, ..., thirty-first) 
; Y             Year

; Each mailbox is listed in the form <mailbox>=<password>,<name>,<email>,<pager_email>,<options>
; if the e-mail is specified, a message will be sent when a message is
; received, to the given mailbox. If pager is specified, a message will be
; sent there as well. If the password is prefixed by '-', then it is
; considered to be unchangeable.
;
; Advanced options example is extension 4069
; NOTE: All options can be expressed globally in the general section, and
; overridden in the per-mailbox settings, unless listed otherwise.
; 
; tz=central 		; Timezone from zonemessages below. Irrelevant if envelope=no.
; attach=yes 		; Attach the voicemail to the notification email *NOT* the pager email
; attachfmt=wav49	; Which format to attach to the email.  Normally this is the
			; first format specified in the format parameter above, but this
			; option lets you customize the format sent to particular mailboxes.
			; Useful if Windows users want wav49, but Linux users want gsm.
			; [per-mailbox only]
; saycid=yes 		; Say the caller id information before the message. If not described, 
			;     or set to no, it will be in the envelope
; cidinternalcontexts=intern	; Internal Context for Name Playback instead of 
			; extension digits when saying caller id.
; sayduration=no 	; Turn on/off the duration information before the message. [ON by default]
; saydurationm=2        ; Specify the minimum duration to say. Default is 2 minutes
; dialout=fromvm ; Context to dial out from [option 4 from mailbox's advanced menu]. 
                 ; If not specified, option 4 will not be listed and dialing out 
                 ; from within VoiceMailMain() will not be permitted.
sendvoicemail=yes ; Allow the user to compose and send a voicemail while inside 
                  ; VoiceMailMain() [option 5 from mailbox's advanced menu].
                  ; If set to 'no', option 5 will not be listed.
; searchcontexts=yes	; Current default behavior is to search only the default context
			; if one is not specified.  The older behavior was to search all contexts.
			; This option restores the old behavior [DEFAULT=no]
			; Note: If you have this option enabled, then you will be required to have
			; unique mailbox names across all contexts. Otherwise, an ambiguity is created
			; since it is impossible to know which mailbox to retrieve when one is requested.
; callback=fromvm 	; Context to call back from  
			;     if not listed, calling the sender back will not be permitted
; exitcontext=fromvm    ; Context to go to on user exit such as * or 0
                        ;     The default is the current context.
; review=yes 		; Allow sender to review/rerecord their message before saving it [OFF by default
; operator=yes      ; Allow sender to hit 0 before/after/during leaving a voicemail to
                    ; reach an operator.  This option REQUIRES an 'o' extension in the
                    ; same context (or in exitcontext, if set), as that is where the
                    ; 0 key will send you.  [OFF by default]
; envelope=no 		; Turn on/off envelope playback before message playback. [ON by default] 
			;     This does NOT affect option 3,3 from the advanced options menu
; delete=yes		; After notification, the voicemail is deleted from the server. [per-mailbox only]
			;     This is intended for use with users who wish to receive their 
			;     voicemail ONLY by email. Note:  "deletevoicemail" is provided as an
			;     equivalent option for Realtime configuration.
; volgain=0.0		; Emails bearing the voicemail may arrive in a volume too
			;     quiet to be heard.  This parameter allows you to specify how
			;     much gain to add to the message when sending a voicemail.
			;     NOTE: sox must be installed for this option to work.
; nextaftercmd=yes	; Skips to the next message after hitting 7 or 9 to delete/save current message.
			;     [global option only at this time] 
; forcename=yes		; Forces a new user to record their name.  A new user is
			;     determined by the password being the same as
			;     the mailbox number.  The default is "no".
; forcegreetings=no	; This is the same as forcename, except for recording
			;     greetings.  The default is "no".
; hidefromdir=yes	; Hide this mailbox from the directory produced by app_directory
			;     The default is "no".
