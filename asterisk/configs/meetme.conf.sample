;audiobuffers=32	; The number of 20ms audio buffers to be used
			; when feeding audio frames from non-Zap channels
			; into the conference; larger numbers will allow
			; for the conference to 'de-jitter' audio that arrives
			; at different timing than the conference's timing
			; source, but can also allow for latency in hearing
			; the audio from the speaker. Minimum value is 2,
