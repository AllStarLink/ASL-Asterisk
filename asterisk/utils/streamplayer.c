 * \brief A utility for reading from a raw TCP stream
 *
 * This application is intended for use when a raw TCP stream is desired to be
 * used as a music on hold source for Asterisk.  Some devices are capable of
 * taking some kind of audio input and provide it as a raw TCP stream over the
 * network, which is what inspired someone to fund this to be written.
 * However, it would certainly be possible to write your own server application
 * to provide music over a TCP stream from a centralized location.
 *
 * This application is quite simple.  It just reads the data from the TCP
 * stream and dumps it straight to stdout.  Due to the way Asterisk handles
 * music on hold sources, this application checks to make sure writing
 * to stdout will not be a blocking operation before doing so.  If so, the data
 * is just thrown away.  This ensures that the stream will continue to be
 * serviced, even if Asterisk is not currently using the source.
 *
 * \todo Update this application to be able to connect to a stream via HTTP,
 * since that is the #1 most requested feature, and it would be quite useful.
 * A lot of people think that is what this is for and email me when it does
 * not work.  :)
